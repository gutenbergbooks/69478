<small>“THE GRAPES THAT HANG HIGH”</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Beth!</span> Beth Baldwin! Oh, B. B.! Do, for
pity’s sake, stop! Do you expect me to chase you
all over town such a hot day as this? It’s cruelty
to animals to make me run in this awful sun,” and
Mary Devine finally reached Elizabeth Baldwin’s
side, and clung to her school friend’s arm, panting.</p>

<p>“Cruelty to how many animals, Mary?” asked
Beth, laughing. “Are you a whole menagerie?
You remind me of our Marcus when he was a little
fellow. There was a ‘cat concert’ in our back yard
one night, and Marcus put his head out of the
door to see the participants.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Mamma!’ he called, ‘there’s a million
cats out here,’ and when mamma reproved him
for exaggerating, he defended himself by saying:
‘Well, anyway, there’s our old cat and another
one!’”</p>

<p>Mary had regained her breath now, and giggled
over Beth’s little story, but was not to be sidetracked.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
She had something to tell. News was
Mary Devine’s over-mastering passion. To know
what went on all over Hudsonvale, and to distribute
her information generously, “free, gratis,
for nothing,” was the height of her enjoyment.</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin said one evening, after Mary had
been calling on Beth: “They did think some of
starting a local paper here in Hudsonvale; but
they heard of that Devine girl and gave it up. No
need of a newspaper with her in town.”</p>

<p>Now Mary gasped to her friend:</p>

<p>“Oh, Beth! I’ve got something to tell you.
You’d never guess!”</p>

<p>“That’s good of you, dear,” Beth said, her
black eyes dancing. “I hate conundrums. Tell
me.”</p>

<p>“Larry Haven has hired an office in the Hudsonvale
block.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mary! that certainly is news,” Beth
cried. “I never would have guessed that. Has
he hung out his shingle?”</p>

<p>“He’s going to,” declared Mary, who knew all
about it, for her father was janitor of Hudsonvale’s
one brick office building. “He’s taken the
room next to Dr. Coldfoot’s, the dentist’s, suite.
Larry told father that the screams of the dentist’s
patients would not bother him, for he expected his
clients would scream quite as loud when he separated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
them from their money,” and Mary giggled
again. “And oh, Beth! he’s just as handsome!”</p>

<p>“Who is—Dr. Coldfoot?” asked her friend,
innocently.</p>

<p>“Goodness no! You are well aware, Beth Baldwin,
that I meant the village pride, Mr. Lawrence
Haven, just returned from the law school with
his sheepskin.”</p>

<p>Beth laughed again. “I do hope he’ll be successful,”
she said. “His father was a prominent
lawyer, you know.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! <i>I</i> hope he can dance,” responded
Mary. “There’s a great dearth of good dancers
among the boys here in Hudsonvale. You know,
Beth, at graduation last month we girls had to
dance together at our party. Oh dear! I wish
we were going to have it over again! What fun!”</p>

<p>“Larry Haven is no longer a boy,” Beth said
slowly.</p>

<p>Mary laughed. “Of course not. He’s an old
man,” she said saucily. “He’s twenty-two.”</p>

<p>“That is seven years our senior,” said Beth, reflectively.</p>

<p>“<i>Six</i>, in my case, if you please,” said Mary,
smartly. “And what’s six years in a boy? He
could be a lawyer forty times over and <i>I</i> wouldn’t
be afraid of him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>“You have more assurance than most, Mary,”
said Beth, smiling. “I don’t know that I shall
dare even speak to Larry now.”</p>

<p>“Humph! you and he used to be as ‘sticky’ on
each other as two molasses cocoanut balls—you
know you used. He was the white-headed little
boy who used to pull you to school on his sled,”
said Mary, airily.</p>

<p>“But that was a long time ago,” said Beth, with
laughter. “I haven’t seen Larry since last winter’s
holidays—and then scarcely more than to
wave my hand to him. He’s grown quite away
from us Hudsonvale girls and boys since his sophomore
year at college.”</p>

<p>“My! how he <i>did</i> puff himself and walk turkey
his first two years at college,” said the slangy
Mary. “The only boy from Hudsonvale who ever
went to a real, big school, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But Larry wasn’t spoiled,” Beth hastened to
say. “He’s so sweet-tempered.”</p>

<p>“Oh! <i>you</i> know how sweet he is if anybody
does,” chuckled Mary. “Well! I must turn off
here. Where are you going, Beth?”</p>

<p>“Just across town on an errand,” her friend
said evasively; for it was the gossipy girl’s nature
to repeat to the next person she talked with anything
she had learned from her previous companion,
no matter how trivial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>“Not that I would mind if the whole town knew
I was going to old Mrs. Crummit’s for a dozen
fresh eggs,” thought Beth, with inward laughter.
“But I <i>do</i> wish Mary Devine was not such a ‘Babbling
Bess.’”</p>

<p>The girl’s mind, however, was filled with
thoughts springing from the bit of news her school
friend had told her. She and Mary had but recently
graduated from the high school. And Larry
Haven, the only son of the widowed Mrs. Euphemia
Haven, had recently returned to his home
with his diploma as a lawyer. Beth knew he had
already been admitted to the county bar.</p>

<p>Beth’s mother and Euphemia Griswold had been
bosom friends in girlhood. At first, after Euphemia
Griswold had married Mr. Haven, the leading
lawyer of the county and a scion of one of the
oldest, if not one of the wealthiest, families in the
State, she and Priscilla Baldwin, who had married
a foreman in the Locomotive Works, remained
very good friends.</p>

<p>The Haven baby carriage was often pushed
along the pleasantly shaded walks of Hudsonvale
side by side with the more plebian carriage containing
the Baldwins’ first little one, who later had
died. The two young women remained inseparable
friends for some years.</p>

<p>Then had come the death of her first child, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
for a long period of time after this Mrs. Baldwin
mingled but little with her friends. This was
followed by a long illness. But, after a few years,
Beth, now the oldest of her brood, came to give
the foreman’s wife a new and better interest in
life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, her old-time chum had grown away
from her. Mr. Haven had become a corporation
lawyer and was fast growing rich. He and his
family had always had entrance into the most exclusive
society of the State. Had he not died suddenly
when Larry was ten years old, he might have
been a national figure in politics.</p>

<p>In dying, he had left Mrs. Euphemia Haven
and her only child fairly well-to-do. The property
had to be conserved with some shrewdness,
perhaps; but the widow lived in one of the finest
old houses in Hudsonvale, entertained well, and
seemed to have everything her heart desired.
Larry was given an excellent education; and it was
understood that he was to follow in his father’s
footsteps, for he must earn his own living now that
he was of age, his mother having full rights in the
property as long as she lived.</p>

<p>Mrs. Haven was not a snob. Although now the
acknowledged leader of such society as there was
in Hudsonvale (which was really a sprawling
river-town surrounding the Locomotive Works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
and coal-tar Dye Factory), she had often come to
see her old friend, Mrs. Baldwin, while Larry was
still small. So it was that the soft-spoken, gentle
boy, with the watchful gray eyes and firm mouth,
came to be a companion of Beth Baldwin’s while
she was little.</p>

<p>He took her to school on her first day; and sat
beside her and held her plump little hand for an
hour, too, because she was afraid. He had drawn
Beth to school on his sled, as Mary Devine said.
Larry was as much at home in the Baldwin house
when a child as he was in his own. Perhaps more
at home, for there was more gaiety in the little
cottage on Bemis Street, which soon began to be
crowded with young life after Beth was born.</p>

<p>There was Marcus, two years Beth’s junior;
Ella, now a flyaway child of eleven; Prissy—named
after her mother—as sweet and loving as
a child could be; and Fred and Ferd, the twins,
six years old. They had all looked on Larry
Haven as almost an elder brother.</p>

<p>For two years, however, as Beth had intimated
to Mary Devine, Larry had not been much at the
Baldwin home. Indeed, he had been in Hudsonvale
but seldom. His summers had been spent in
preparing for the law school, for he was very
desirous to get ahead. His exceeding industry had
brought results. He was a very young man, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
to have succeeded in securing his diploma
and entering upon public life as he now had.</p>

<p>As Beth Baldwin went her way, these thoughts
weaved through her mind. And, too, she compared
her own lot to that of her whilom playmate and
confidant. When Beth learned that Larry was to
go to college and finally enter the law school, she
had expressed her intention of getting the maximum
amount of education to be secured by a girl—and
Larry had encouraged her to try for it.</p>

<p>Beth had stood well in her classes all through
her high-school course. She had graduated among
the first ten pupils in the class. She possessed a
deep longing to continue her course. But——</p>

<p>“There’s about as much chance of my going to
Rivercliff as there is of my getting an aeroplane
and soaring in it to the Heights of Parnassus,”
Beth told herself, with a little laugh and a little
sigh. She was not of a melancholy disposition,
and even the seriousness of her desire to learn and
to achieve, in her way, as much as Larry had
achieved in his, could not make her gloomy.</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin earned three dollars and seventy-five
cents a day as foreman of the erecting shop in
the Hudsonvale Locomotive Works. The family
had often “figured and refigured” that sum; but
they could not make it come to more than twenty-two
dollars and fifty cents a week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>Marcus, although but thirteen, was already talking
bravely about going to work. In another half
year he could get his certificate and become an aid
in the family’s support.</p>

<p>“While I,” thought Beth, shaking her head,
“am desirous of adding to its burdens for three
years to come. But then—if I only <i>could</i>—I know
I could pay them all back,” she sighed.</p>

<p>It was Beth’s desire to take a normal and teacher’s
course in a very thorough boarding school up
the river. Having a diploma from Rivercliff
would enable her to obtain a certificate to teach
in the State schools. That was her aim—to be
self-supporting, as well as to obtain an education
the equal of that Larry Haven had secured.</p>

<p>She had surreptitiously dipped into Larry’s
college textbooks when he was at home during his
freshman and sophomore years, and she was sure
that such studies were not beyond her comprehension.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” thought Beth, “the grapes that
hang highest are always the sweetest. How am I
ever going to get admission to Rivercliff School;
or, once admitted, how am I to remain there the
necessary three years? Dear me! if Larry——”</p>

<p>Just then she looked up before crossing the
street and gazed directly into the calm, rather
proud face of Larry’s mother who, in her little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
electric runabout, was just drawing in to the opposite
curb.</p>

<p>Mrs. Euphemia Haven was tall, of good figure,
with beautiful hair, beginning to be touched with
gray, that her maid dressed more becomingly than
was any other woman’s hair in Hudsonvale. She
had a good complexion, with a tinge of natural
pink in the cheeks and lips. Her teeth were even
and white, without the defects of gold showing
the handiwork of the dentist. She dressed exquisitely,
Beth thought.</p>

<p>Mrs. Haven drove her runabout with the assurance
of a boy. She had steady nerves, a cordial
laugh, a smile that was charming, and knew
always how to put one at his ease. She beckoned
now to Beth as the latter crossed the street, crying:</p>

<p>“Elizabeth! Beth! Come here, please! You
are just the person I must see.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>LARRY’S “COMING OUT” PARTY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Euphemia Haven</span> was very careful in
her choice of words. Not that her diction was
better or worse than most people’s; but she was
very exact in saying just what she meant to say.</p>

<p>Instead of calling to Beth Baldwin that she
“wished” to see her or “needed” to see her, she
said “I must.” Behind that expression lay a rather
sharp controversy between her son, Larry, and
herself at the breakfast table that very morning.
It was seldom that there was any friction at all
between Mrs. Haven and her son, for she was a
very indulgent mother and Larry was quite unspoiled,
despite every chance in the world for his
having been so affected.</p>

<p>She never interfered with his pleasures, seldom
with his associates, and never balked his plans.
He, on the other hand, never gave his mother a
moment’s uneasiness, for she was assured that he
was a Haven and would do nothing to smirch the
family name.</p>

<p>Mrs. Haven did not blame her son for having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
been so friendly with the family on Bemis Street.
She, herself, had loved Priscilla Lomis with all
her rather narrow heart when they were young.
That Priscilla had married a mechanic was her
mistake; and Mrs. Euphemia had condoned that
mistake for years. But now she had to think of
her son’s future. There were some past associations
which she felt might better be ignored by
him now that he was a man. The silly plans in
her own and Priscilla Baldwin’s heads when they
were young married women, each with a brand
new baby to think of and talk about, Mrs. Haven
long since had thought best forgotten.</p>

<p>She feared, however, that Priscilla might have
remembered. Of course, that first dear little girl
baby of her old friend’s had died; but here was
another girl born into the family of the mechanic——</p>

<p>“And goodness!” thought Mrs. Haven, as Beth
Baldwin crossed the street and drew near at her
call, “what a perfect little beauty she is growing to
be!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Euphemia Haven was one of those women
who manage a lorgnette very well indeed. She
caught it up now and looked at Beth through it—not
because she really needed this aid to sight,
but to cover a sudden slight confusion that she
felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“Mercy, Beth! how really pretty you have
grown!” was her first audible comment. “And
what a big girl! The other day you were only
a little thing and Larry was playing nurse-girl to
you. I expect he remembers you now as the little
black-eyed tot he used to be so devoted to.”</p>

<p>“I presume so, Mrs. Haven,” replied Beth,
composedly.</p>

<p>“Why, you must be through school,” went on
Mrs. Haven. “Are you working or do you help
your mother?”</p>

<p>“It is work helping in a family of eight, Mrs.
Haven,” laughed Beth. “I have finished high
school. But I hope to go to a more advanced
school in the fall.”</p>

<p>“That will be rather difficult, will it not?” suggested
Mrs. Haven, with raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>Beth knew that it was an intimation that Mrs.
Haven fully understood the Baldwin’s financial
circumstances. It was not said unkindly; yet,
somehow, Beth felt that it was antagonistic. Her
pretty head came up and she looked rather proudly
into the fine eyes of Larry’s mother.</p>

<p>“Yes; it will be very difficult,” she admitted.
“But I mean to get a better education if I have to
earn the money myself to pay my way through
school.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said Mrs. Haven, smiling. “What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
a very determined girl! But—in your case, my
dear—is an advanced education really worth
while?”</p>

<p>“I think it is,” and this time Beth flushed. She
recognized the critical note in her questioner’s
voice, and she knew what it meant. “Don’t you
think it was worth while for Larry to go to college?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” ejaculated the startled lady. “He—he
is a boy.”</p>

<p>“And <i>I</i> am a girl,” Beth laughed. “But I think
I have just as much ambition as any boy.”</p>

<p>The lady laughed too, and said:</p>

<p>“That brings me to the reason I had for hailing
you, my dear. Now that Larry is home for
good I want to give him a nice party. The young
folk of Hudsonvale, I am afraid, have almost forgotten
him. And, too, he is ambitious to take his
father’s place in the community as a lawyer. We
must introduce him to the older generation likewise.
So, when we were talking it over this morning,
he remembered you and told me to be sure to
invite ‘that little Baldwin girl.’ Why!” and Larry’s
mother laughed easily, as though she did not
know she had conveyed a sting, “he will scarcely
know you, you have grown so.”</p>

<p>“How kind of him to remember me,” Beth said
sweetly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Oh, Larry has always looked upon you as a
little sister, I fancy—having been denied any of
his own. Now, you will come, of course? Next
Tuesday evening. There will be dancing.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Haven had managed to make Beth feel
that she was being patronized; but the girl was
too sensible to take offence. She believed Larry
had really said that he wanted her at his party,
and she would not disappoint her old playfellow.</p>

<p>“I will surely come, Mrs. Haven. Thank you,”
she said, as the lady’s car started.</p>

<p>As Beth told her mother when she arrived home
with the eggs, she had nothing but her graduation
dress to wear to Larry’s “coming out” party, as
Beth laughingly designated it, and that frock had
been made with the view to its being her “best-Sunday-go-to-meeting”
attire for two years to
come. A new dress was an event in the Baldwin
household.</p>

<p>“It’s not just the thing for an evening party,
Mamma,” she said cheerfully. “But we’ll make
it do.”</p>

<p>“I really would like to have you look your best
when you go to Euphemia Haven’s,” Mrs. Baldwin
answered.</p>

<p>“Of course! I shall scrub my face real clean
and comb all the tangles out of my hair, Mother
mine,” laughed Beth. “Why strive to amaze Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Haven with my fine appearance more than anybody
else?”</p>

<p>“Why? Oh well! I want her to see what a
very nice girl you are.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mamma! She has already told
me I am pretty,” and Beth made a little face at
the thought of Mrs. Euphemia Haven’s patronizing
way.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Beth had a desire to look her best
if she attended the “coming out” party. But she
wished to astonish another person rather than the
rather haughty Mrs. Euphemia Haven.</p>

<p>That dress had to be thought about—and there
were only four days before the date of the party.
Beth was glad she had worn it only on graduation
day. It would not be familiar to anybody but her
classmates; and she fancied that if any of them
were at Larry’s party they would be likely to appear
in their graduation dresses, too. For Hudsonvale
was not a very fashionable place.</p>

<p>The frock in question was of a good quality
of cream-colored poplin—then a very popular
fabric. It had been made high in the neck, for
low-cut frocks for day wear were not approved in
Hudsonvale. Evening wear was different. Decolleté
was expected of any one who was invited to
an evening party.</p>

<p>For a girl of her age Beth Baldwin’s taste was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
admirable. Yet, because of her complexion, she
could “carry off” oddities in style and colorings
that scarcely any other girl in the village would
have dared attempt.</p>

<p>She was handy, too, with her needle, and she
decided to make some changes and adapt her dress
for evening wear. She removed the long sleeves,
and her mother gave her the lace out of her own
wedding gown—so long laid away in camphor—with
which she fashioned a soft, full, puff-like
sleeve which reached only half way to her elbow.
After removing the collar and the vest of the
frock, she filled in over the shoulders and across
the bust with some of the same pretty lace. Between
the lace and the material of the dress she
put beading, and in this she ran narrow cherry-colored
ribbon. She put a rosette on each
shoulder, a large one with streamers over her
heart, other ribbons with very tiny rosettes to tie
the puff-like sleeves, and made ready a sash of
broad ribbon of the same hue.</p>

<p>The effect might be a trifle bizarre; but it was
very becoming, indeed, to Beth, and when she put
on the frock Monday evening and “tried it out”
on the family, they thought her charming.</p>

<p>“Some class to you,” said the slangy Marcus.
“Cricky! you’re the niftiest looking girl in the
town—isn’t she, Pop?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“She’s what her mother was over again,” said
Mr. Baldwin, proudly, lowering his paper to
“peck” at his pretty daughter’s cheek.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamma! I don’t see why you didn’t have
<i>me</i> a dark and delirious beauty,” groaned Ella,
“instead of a washed-out, flaxen-haired, inconsequential
looking little <i>dowdy</i>! I hate to go anywhere
with our Beth; she makes me look like <i>just
nothing</i>.”</p>

<p>The family laughed at the flyaway’s plaint, and
Ella added:</p>

<p>“Anyway, I hope Beth will get married long
before I get any beaux. I know I couldn’t keep
’em a minute if they came here and saw Beth.”</p>

<p>“Mercy, Ella!” gasped her mother. “What
are you talking about—a child of eleven?”</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin laughed heartily. He usually did
at his flaxen-haired daughter’s nonsense. But
Ella added:</p>

<p>“I don’t care, Mamma. It should be against
the law for one sister to be so much prettier than
the others. Poor little Prissy and me—why, we
haven’t any chance at all!”</p>

<p>“‘Handsome is as handsome does,’ daughter,”
quoted Mrs. Baldwin, contemplating her eldest
child with her head on one side.</p>

AROUND BETH’S THROAT.<br>

<span class="illoright2">Page <a href="#Page_21">21</a>.</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes! that’s what Mr. Monkey said to the
poor little Hippopotamus baby. He found little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
Hippo crying beside a still pool,” said the vivacious
Ella, “and asked him what the matter was.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, nuffin,’ said the Hippo, ‘only I never saw
myself in a mirror before!’</p>

<p>“And, of course, Mr. Monkey said just what
you did now, Mamma. But poor little Hippo
knew that he couldn’t act handsome enough in a
thousand years to overcome the handicap of the
awful looks Nature had given him.”</p>

<p>Through the laughter of Mr. Baldwin and Marcus,
Ferd, the blond twin, spoke up stoutly:</p>

<p>“I don’t care if they <i>do</i> call me ‘Blondy.’ I
wouldn’t be black, like Fred.”</p>

<p>“I’m certainly glad I’m a bruin, like our Beth,”
said his twin, loftily.</p>

<p>“‘Bruin!’”</p>

<p>“A bear that boy certainly is!”</p>

<p>“Goodness, Frederick,” said Ella, amid the
laughter of the family. “You mean brunette.”</p>

<p>Fred did not take laughter kindly. “I know
what I mean,” he growled. “I’m glad my complexion
is like Beth’s.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, it isn’t!” cried the flyaway sister,
suddenly. “You haven’t washed your face since
supper, Frederick Baldwin! Come out to the
kitchen sink with me this very minute!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baldwin had left the room while this
conversation was in progress. Now she returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
with a little square box that the children seldom
saw. It was usually locked away in the safe in
the bedroom occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamma!” gasped Beth, suspecting what
was coming.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mother!” said Mr. Baldwin, with
twinkling eye. “Getting out the ‘family jewels?’”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamma!” shrieked Ella, racing in from
the kitchen, dragging Fred with one hand and
waving the washcloth in the other like a very limp
banner. “<i>Not Great-grandmother Lomis’ corals?</i>”</p>

<p>Beth flushed and paled, her eyes shining like
stars as she watched her mother unlock the little
box with the key that always hung about her neck
under her gown. Great-grandmother Lomis’ corals
was the one heirloom that had been handed
down to Mrs. Baldwin’s generation. They were
as precious in the eyes of her daughters as the
Queen of Sheba’s pearls.</p>

<p>“You’re never going to let me wear <i>those</i> to
Larry’s ‘coming out’ party?” Beth finally gasped.</p>

<p>Her mother’s face was serious. “You are the
eldest, my dear. The corals will be yours some
day—yours to do with just what you please.
Great-grandmother Lomis declared in her will that
the corals should always be given to the eldest
daughter, and from her to <i>her</i> eldest daughter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
This is an entail that the male heirs have nothing
to do with,” and she laughed.</p>

<p>“They may be sold or otherwise disposed of
for the benefit of the eldest daughter of each generation.
If Beth wants to wear them to Euphemia’s—— There!”</p>

<p>She snapped the thin, beautifully carved, blood-red
necklace around Beth’s throat. The deeper
hue of the corals contrasted beautifully with the
brighter ribbons, and against the dark loveliness
of Beth’s skin the necklace had never shone to better
advantage.</p>

<p>There was a pin, too; and Mrs. Baldwin swiftly
snipped off the big rosette at Beth’s bosom and
caught the filmy lace together there with the beautiful
pin instead.</p>

<p>The corals set off the girl’s beauty wonderfully.
There was an alluring, Eastern quality to it that
now, enhanced by the old-fashioned jewelry, made
Beth seem more mature than she really was.</p>

<p>Yet she was only a simple, sweet child, after
all. She possessed a better figure than most girls
of her age, and had a demure, self-possessed manner
that might have led strangers to think her
older than she was. In mind and heart, however,
though thoughtful to a degree, Beth was a child.</p>

<p>“That’s mighty scrumptious—that’s what <i>I</i> call
it,” declared Marcus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>Perhaps Mr. Baldwin thought so too; for the
next evening, when Beth was ready to start for
the Haven house, a taxicab stopped at the door.</p>

<p>“Papa Baldwin! What extravagance!” exclaimed
his wife.</p>

<p>“It’s not considered quite the thing, I believe,”
he said drily, “for a young lady to walk to a party
wearing three or four hundred dollars’ worth of
jewelry.”</p>

<p>Not until then did Mrs. Baldwin wonder if she
were doing wrong to allow Beth to wear the family
heirloom. But it was too late to say no. Beth
kissed her hand to the watching family from the
taxicab—the man shut the door, and in a moment
the machine rolled away from the little cottage on
Bemis Street.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>GREAT-GRANDMOTHER LOMIS’ CORALS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth Baldwin</span> felt that this was really her
first “grown-up” party. She knew that few of the
girls who had graduated with her from high
school had been invited to the Haven house on this
evening; and few of the younger guests would be
brought to the door, she was likewise sure, in any
vehicle. There were but four taxicabs in the town.</p>

<p>Beth knew that to the very nicest parties in
town most people went afoot, carrying their dancing
slippers under their arms. But now the girl
was set down before the Haven door, under an
awning and on a well-worn strip of carpet, both
of which led up to the wide-open and brilliantly
lighted doorway of the mansion.</p>

<p>The Haven place was a fine old house; there
was none better for the purpose of entertaining
in town. Almost the whole of the lower floor
could be used for dancing. The broad stairway,
bordered by potted plants, offered plenty of “nestling
corners” for tired dancers; palms hid the rear
of the reception hall where the musicians were stationed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Already, when Beth timidly entered, the
lights, the moving couples, the tinkle of music, the
murmur of voices, were quite confusing.</p>

<p>She saw Mrs. Euphemia Haven’s stately figure
just within the drawing-room doorway. A few
couples swung in time to the music across the hall
in the huge dining-room, from which all the furniture
had been taken. There were people going
up and down the stairway whom she had never
even seen before. She had not stopped to think
until now that, after all, Larry Haven lived in a
world quite apart from the Baldwins.</p>

<p>Her mother’s very good cravanette hid Beth’s
frock from throat to slippers. She wore no head-covering
save the waves of her pretty black hair.
For Beth was one of those fortunate girls who
possess soft looking, wavy hair, adaptable to any
style of hair-dressing.</p>

<p>She was directed to the dressing rooms above,
and mounted the stairs. There a maid showed her
to one of the large bedrooms, now set apart for
the women to use as a dressing room.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Beth descended the stairway.
She saw at its foot a group of people looking up
at her. Mrs. Haven was not one of them. Indeed,
Beth thought she knew none of the group—at
least, none of the women.</p>

<p>She imagined that they were whispering about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
her. The suspicion heightened the color in her
cheeks; but she could not afford to be panic-stricken
now. Beyond this group—wavering a little
in her sight because Beth saw her through a
mist—she knew Mrs. Haven stood.</p>

<p>She stepped from the lower tread of the stairway,
and—— Who was this who met her, both
hands outstretched, lips smiling, gray eyes dancing?
Such a tall young man, strikingly handsome,
Beth thought, in his evening clothes, his shock of
straw-colored hair brushed back from his brow,
giving him a remarkably wide-awake appearance.</p>

<p>“Larry!” she said, almost in a whisper, giving
him her hands.</p>

<p>“You howling little beauty!” he responded, in
a tone equally confidential. “Mother did not prepare
me for <i>this</i> change. Goodness, Beth! you’ve
grown up!”</p>

<p>“No, no. But <i>you</i> have,” she said, flutteringly.</p>

<p>He laughed. Then he tucked Beth’s plump little
hand under his arm and led her into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Mater,” he said, for she chanced to be alone
at the moment, “I introduce you to the ‘belle of
the ball.’ What do you know about our little
‘Saint Elizabeth?’ Hasn’t she grown up?”</p>

<p>“Mercy, child!” murmured Mrs. Haven, and
the lorgnette came into play to rescue her from absolute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
confusion. “I told you, Larry, how really
pretty she had grown. In a few years, Beth, you
will set the young men’s hearts aflame. Introduce
her to some of the others—do, Larry. So she
will not feel lonesome,” and the lady patted Beth’s
arm with her lorgnette.</p>

<p>“And your Great-grandmother Lomis’ corals. I
always envied your mother those beauties,” said
the matron. “But I had no idea Priscilla had kept
them all these years.”</p>

<p>“Why,” gasped Beth, finally stung to self-defense,
“they are heirlooms!”</p>

<p>“Oh—yes—of course,” Mrs. Haven said. “But
it isn’t every one who can afford to keep heirlooms,
you know.”</p>

<p>Beth felt the sting in every word Larry’s mother
uttered. She knew Mrs. Haven was antagonistic
to her. Why?</p>

<p>“Do introduce her to some of the young folk,
Larry,” his mother said impatiently.</p>

<p>“Not till I’ve danced once with her myself,
Mater,” said the young man, laughing. “I can
see plainly that if I don’t take my chance to do so
right now, I’m likely to have none. Our little
Beth is going to cut a wide swath to-night.”</p>

<p>“Mercy!” murmured his mother. “What are
these children coming to?”</p>

<p>“You must not treat me as though I were grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
up, Larry,” Beth said, laughing, as the orchestra
struck up again.</p>

<p>“Know this?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Beth, glad she had learned some
of the new steps.</p>

<p>“Then come on—and tell me all about yourself
while we dance,” Larry rejoined.</p>

<p>“Oh no! <i>You</i> are the interesting subject just
now. Think! a full-fledged lawyer,” she told him.</p>

<p>“Yes—‘full-fledged,’ indeed,” he agreed. “And
likely to get well plucked the first time I appear
in court.”</p>

<p>“Does the thought of your first case scare you?”
she asked roguishly.</p>

<p>“No. The fear that there won’t be a first case
is what is troubling me. They tell me fledgling
lawyers sometimes starve to death and are swept
up with the dust in their offices and thrown out.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have Mary Devine watch over you. Her
father is janitor of the block, you know. If you
are seen to become emaciated, we will try to smuggle
you in some food,” laughed Beth.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how long I shall be at it,” the
young man said, with more seriousness; “but I
mean if possible to make the name of Haven
known—and respected—as it used to be among
the ‘legal lights.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope so, Larry!” she declared, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
warmth. “We all at our house will ‘boost’ for
you.”</p>

<p>“And all the kids are well?” he asked, looking
down at her with frank admiration.</p>

<p>“Lovely. And fast growing up. You should
see Ella! She is going to be a regular ash-blonde.”</p>

<p>“I never did fancy light-complexioned people,”
said Larry, laughing at her. “You suit me, Beth.”</p>

<p>“‘Thank you kindly, sir, she said,’” returned
Beth, courtesying. “But remember, please, that
my mother considers me a child.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! pooh! and a couple of fudges! You
are a stunner, Beth.”</p>

<p>“I am a schoolgirl; you must not turn my head
with compliments.”</p>

<p>“Got through the high, Elizabeth?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And going in for the higher-ed., of course?”</p>

<p>“Just as sure—as sure!” she said firmly. “I
don’t know just how, yet; but I mean to go to
Rivercliff in the autumn.”</p>

<p>“Whew! That’s some school. I met some girls
at college who had been there. Co-eds, you know.”</p>

<p>“Nice girls?”</p>

<p>“Awfully nice,” he declared. “They took two
years at Rivercliff after high and then came to
college. But the full course up there would put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
you ahead a whole lot, Beth. These girls I speak
of were preparing for particular lines of work.
If a girl wanted to be a teacher——”</p>

<p>“That is my goal, Larry,” Beth interrupted, so
earnestly that she missed her step. “I <i>must</i> be a
teacher. You know—papa isn’t rich. We have
to scrimp a good deal. If I could teach I could
help a lot.”</p>

<p>“Sure you could,” he agreed, with answering enthusiasm.
“And, besides, a girl doesn’t get anywhere
at all now if she hasn’t a pretty good education.
You know how it is—a fellow likes to talk
to a girl that can discuss the same things he can,
and discuss them intelligently. Why, Beth,” and
he laughed, “our great-grandmothers, who only
knew how to sew and knit and bake and be domestic,
would never get a chance to marry nowadays.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense you talk,” said Beth, dimpling.
“Papa says that the nearest way to a man’s heart
is through his stomach. I fancy that not <i>all</i> young
men of our generation are dyspeptic and have to
live on predigested health foods.”</p>

<p>“That is all right,” Larry said seriously. “But
a fellow can hire a cook. He wants a wife who
can be his mental companion.”</p>

<p>“Good-ness me!” drawled Beth. “Hear the
boy! When are you going to get married, Larry
Haven? How soon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Just as soon as I find the right girl,” he returned,
laughing at her.</p>

<p>“Do you expect her to starve to death in your
law offices, too?” she demanded, quizzically.</p>

<p>The question brought him to a stop. He gazed
down at her for a moment. “Got me there, Elizabeth—got
me there,” he admitted. “I didn’t
think of that. She will have to be supported—the
future Mrs. Haven—won’t she?”</p>

<p>“And a cook hired for her, too,” Beth responded
wickedly. “By the time you are able to
do that, Larry Haven, on your income as an attorney,
I shall be principal of a young ladies’ seminary
at five thousand a year.”</p>

<p>He laughed delightedly. She was just as bright
as he remembered her to have been when she was
little.</p>

<p>He handed her over to Major Whipple after
this dance. The major, although a bachelor of
over fifty, still possessed a discriminating eye for
beauty. And he could dance well, too. Beth was
enjoying herself. Larry did not let her sit idle a
single dance. And the boys, young men, middle-aged
men, were all ready to be partners with her.</p>

<p>Larry said to his mother: “What did I tell you,
Mater? Beth is the belle of the evening.”</p>

<p>“You will turn that child’s head, Larry. I warn
you,” his mother said seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“Well! she talks a whole lot more sensibly than
most of the young women I have talked with this
evening,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Ah! she is wiser than I thought,” murmured
Mrs. Haven. “And I <i>would</i> like to own those
corals of her Great-grandmother Lomis.”</p>

<small>THE SACRIFICE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">But</span> why did she try to make me appear so
young?” Beth asked her mother, as they sat side
by side busily sewing the afternoon following Larry’s
party. “Really, I felt hurt. I cannot understand
Mrs. Haven.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baldwin looked at her eldest daughter
thoughtfully—as though, however, her mind were
a great way off.</p>

<p>“Why did she, Mother?” repeated Beth.</p>

<p>“I can understand Euphemia,” said Mrs. Baldwin,
quietly. “You must not mind her, my dear.”</p>

<p>“But I cannot see why she wants me to seem
childish, even if you do, Mother mine,” the girl
said, somewhat impatiently.</p>

<p>“I fear one meaning is, that Euphemia feels
that Larry would better remember you only as his
playfellow when he, too, was a child,” Mrs. Baldwin
said. “He is a man now, you know, and
must have a man’s feelings as he has a man’s duties
to perform.”</p>

<p>“Why, what nonsense, Mother!” exclaimed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
girl, throwing back her head and laughing delightedly.
“He is only a great, big boy—that’s
all Larry Haven is.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baldwin shook her head, gravely. “You
do not understand the difference between fifteen
and twenty-two,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes, Ma’am, I do,” the girl responded smartly.
“I know my arithmetic. It’s seven years—just
seven years, Mother mine.”</p>

<p>“That is not the real difference, Beth,” her
mother pursued. “The difference is not to be
measured by time——”</p>

<p>“No! One would think it were eternity to
hear you,” laughed Beth.</p>

<p>Her mother laughed too; yet she was more
serious than Beth could see any occasion for.</p>

<p>“There is a freshness and a boyishness about
young men—and some men when they become
older—that make them seem less mature than
quite young girls,” Mrs. Baldwin said, finding it
a little difficult to impress her daughter with the
change in her whilom playmate.</p>

<p>“Larry Haven has stepped over the line from
boyhood to manhood, whether you realize it or
not, Beth. There is a vast difference now between
you two. You look forward to study and the acquirement
of text-book knowledge——”</p>

<p>“Oh! how much!” murmured Beth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“While he looks back upon his school course.
The difference between knowledge wished for,
and knowledge attained, is vast. It isn’t measured
by mere time, as I said before. It is a difference
in the attitude of one’s mind toward most things
in the world. However much Larry may seem
just the same as he used to be, he is not the same.
He is a man grown, and you are only a girl.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamma! That is a sharp one,” said
Beth, laughing placidly. “I really can’t see that
being fifteen instead of twenty-two makes much
difference between Larry and me. I can still make
him say just the thing I want him to say—I always
could. And I can still get the best of him in an
argument.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baldwin had to laugh, although it was not
a very cheerful laugh. “Your being able to argue
did not come from your studies in school, child,
that is sure. You have always been good at that.
You would argue now that you and Larry were
equal.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I realize our inequality, Mamma,” Beth
said sadly. “It’s the difference in our education,
not our ages, that troubles me. He may be only
a boy, but he’s got something in his head that I
haven’t. And oh, Mamma! I want it so!”</p>

<p>“My dear girl!”</p>

<p>“I know. It is wicked, but I must say it. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
told Larry last night that I meant to go to Rivercliff
this September. And I mean to! It seems to
me that I would sacrifice almost anything for the
chance to go there. I <i>must</i> go!”</p>

<p>“My dear!”</p>

<p>“Yes. It sounds dreadful, doesn’t it? I just
get desperate when I think of how badly I want
to learn. And if I don’t become a teacher, what is
to become of me? Am I to go into the dye factory
to earn my living? Dear Mother! I must earn
my living somehow. The children are getting
bigger, and need more and more. They must be
educated, too. If I could get my teacher’s certificate
in three years I could help you all.”</p>

<p>“I know—I know, child,” said her mother.
“You would help us if you could.”</p>

<p>“Now I’ve made you cry! I’m so sorry! Do
forgive me! But it isn’t that I would help the
family if I <i>could</i>. It is that I <i>must</i>! Don’t you
see it, Mamma? Papa is getting no younger.
Already Marcus talks of going to work. Am I
better than my brother? The family needs my
help as much as it needs his. And I should be able
to do more than he.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear——” cried Mrs. Baldwin, surprised
by the girl’s earnestness. She began to
doubt if her daughter was quite as childish as she
had supposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“At least,” went on Beth, ignoring her mother’s
half-spoken protest, “you must let me go to work
this summer to see if I can earn enough, somehow,
to pay for my first half, if no more, at Rivercliff.”</p>

<p>“And what after that, daughter?” asked Mrs.
Baldwin.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I am reckless—or inspired!”
and Beth laughed shakingly. “A way may be
opened. I’ll take a chance.”</p>

<p>“Where can you get work for the summer?”
her mother asked gravely.</p>

<p>“Well—I would go into the factory for a short
time——”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! what would Larry say? You cannot
do that,” her mother cried, with an energy that
quite surprised Beth.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” sniffed the girl. “I guess you mean,
what would Larry’s mother say? I am not beholden
to Mrs. Haven.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Baldwin, seriously. “But you
would not wish to offend Larry’s mother.”</p>

<p>Beth showed herself puzzled. “Why, not deliberately,”
she said. “Of course not. Nor
Larry either. But why worry about them more
than our other friends? Lots of folks who know
us, and in no better circumstances than we are,
either, will turn up their noses at me if I go to
work in the dye factory. But you know how it is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Mamma. A position in a store or an office is
awfully hard to find in Hudsonvale. You wouldn’t
want me to go to a summer hotel to be a waitress
or a chambermaid?”</p>

<p>“Mercy me, Beth! What are you thinking of?”
almost screamed Mrs. Baldwin.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of making money to pay for my
schooling at Rivercliff,” laughed her daughter.
“I’ve read of lots of girls who earn their tuition
fees by doing those things.”</p>

<p>“But you!”</p>

<p>“Who am I?” asked Beth. “Better than other
girls? You’ve taught me to sweep, to dust, to
make beds, and to be tidy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” Mrs. Baldwin hastened to say.
“Every girl should learn the domestic duties.”</p>

<p>Beth began to giggle at that. “Larry says not.
He’s going to hire a cook when he gets married.
He forgets that the cook may leave suddenly. I
believe they have a way of doing that.”</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake!” gasped her mother.
“What didn’t you and Larry talk about last
night?”</p>

<p>“Why—lots of things. We didn’t have much
time to really talk. We’ll wait till he comes here
to see us to have a really old-fashioned confab together,”
Beth said laughing. “But he’s a funny
boy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“I tell you he is a boy no longer,” Mrs. Baldwin
said, a little worried.</p>

<p>“Oh, wait till you see him. He’s just the same
old sixpence of a Larry. You’ll see, Mamma.
But he is handsome in his dress suit. Doesn’t look
at all like an undertaker.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baldwin, shaking her head, rejoined:</p>

<p>“For you to go to work at any domestic service
is out of the question. And your father would
never hear to your working in the factory.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do then, Mamma? Peddle? Be
an agent? Go from house to house and try to
make people buy what they don’t want and don’t
need and really would be better off without?” and
Beth laughed gaily. “Or shall I go right out with
a mask and a club and become a highway robber?”</p>

<p>Her mother had to laugh again at this suggestion.
Really, Beth was practical in her ideas.
“Much more so than most girls of her age,”
thought the troubled mother, with a sigh.</p>

<p>She could not but be impressed with the earnestness
of Beth’s desire for an education. She had
already had quite as much schooling as Mrs. Baldwin—and
Mrs. Euphemia Haven—had been given
when they were girls.</p>

<p>“But the world is different now,” sighed the
foreman’s wife. “And more is expected of girls.
If Euphemia——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>She did not finish her speech—there were some
things she could not admit even to herself. But
the next afternoon she dressed herself and went
out. “Calling,” she told the curious girls. But
she refused to say on whom she was to call.</p>

<p>After a sleepless night Mrs. Baldwin had made
up her mind that Beth should have her desire if
it were possible. By a sacrifice that she could not
bring herself to tell even Mr. Baldwin about, she
would raise sufficient money to pay for Beth’s first
year at Rivercliff. She was quite sure Euphemia
Haven would buy her Grandmother Lomis’ corals.
For years she had wanted them. And Euphemia
would give four hundred dollars for them.</p>

<p>“It is Beth’s sacrifice, not mine,” the mother
thought, wiping her eyes before she mounted the
walk to the Haven mansion. “And it is to benefit
Beth. I am sure the child would rather have a
year at school than the jewelry.”</p>

<p>She rang the bell and was admitted by the butler.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE “WATER WAGTAIL”</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I obtained</span> the money from a friend. Payment
of the loan need not be considered until your
education at Rivercliff is finished, Beth. This sum
will carry you through your first year in comfort.
Meanwhile, as you say yourself, a way may be
opened for you to continue your course there.
‘Sufficient unto the day.’ Ask no questions.”</p>

<p>Thus said Mrs. Baldwin, in family assembled,
when the outcry was made regarding the suddenly
and mysteriously acquired funds with which Beth
was to storm the heights of Rivercliff School.</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin looked at his wife oddly, but he
asked no question—then or at any subsequent
time. When Mrs. Baldwin was as firm as she
looked now, the others dared not be inquisitive.</p>

<p>But as delighted as Beth was at the sudden opening
of her prospects, she felt that a sacrifice of
some kind had been made. She feared her mother
and father had done some hard thing for which
they might be troubled all through her school
years. She had no suspicion of the truth—not
for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“But I will learn from other girls at school how
to earn money to pay my way. And I’ll pay
mamma back, too,” Beth thought, with but faint
appreciation, after all, of how huge a sum four
hundred dollars is, and how long it would take
to earn and save it in any way open to a girl of
fifteen.</p>

<p>Of course, the whole of it did not have to go
for tuition and board. There would be a small
sum for what Ella called her older sister’s “trousseau,”
and for pocket-money and incidentals.
Rivercliff was a more expensive school than one
or two others Beth had thought of and she wished
she could gain the advantages she craved in some
other institution.</p>

<p>However, a girl with a diploma from Rivercliff
had a distinct advantage over applicants from
other schools with the State Board of Education.
And for good reason. Rivercliff was more than
a preparatory school in the usual acceptation of
the term. A girl who faithfully took the courses
laid down by Miss Hammersly, the principal, was
well fitted for most places in life.</p>

<p>The summer was not spent idly by Beth. She
had not merely resolved to obtain an education at
her parents’ expense. She was ready and willing
to do all in her power to help bring the much desired
thing to pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>She obtained the opportunity of posing on several
occasions for an illustrator for the magazines,
who came each summer to a rustic studio she had
built near Hudsonvale. Beth had done this work
before, and the artist paid her fifty cents an hour.
It was not an easily won fifty cents by any means.
Retaining the poses as was desired strained the
muscles and tired the mind more than most other
work Beth had ever done.</p>

<p>She could crochet, too; but the payment she received
for a baby’s bootees “a fly would starve to
death on,” Ella declared—and with some apparent
truth. However, Beth kept busy and happy.
That is, she told herself she was quite, quite
happy. But there was one thing that troubled her
mind in secret. Larry Haven had never come to
the little cottage on Bemis Street to see her.</p>

<p>From Mary Devine Beth heard much about
Larry. He had established himself in the office
next to Dr. Coldfoot, and——</p>

<p>“Such scrumptious furniture, Beth, you never
<i>did</i> see. They say his mother made him a present
of it all—furnished his office right up to the minute.
And he’s got a very splendid sign,” added
Mary, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Beth had seen the sign.</p>

<p>“And he comes downtown as brisk as a drug
clerk every morning,” giggled Mary, “and shuts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
himself into that office—oh, dreadfully busy, he
is!”</p>

<p>“I hope he will be,” said Beth, laughing.</p>

<p>Nobody said anything to her about Larry’s not
coming to the house. The children were all busy,
and had become so used to his absence that they
did not note its continuance after Larry returned
from the law school.</p>

<p>That her old playmate was busy might be an
excuse for his seldom calling; but there was absolutely
no excuse, that Beth could imagine, for his
never coming to see them. After the first fortnight
following his party, Beth ceased to mention
Larry in the family’s hearing. She was a girl who
could hide her deeper feelings if she so chose;
and she chose now to lead her mother to believe
that thought of Larry never troubled her mind.</p>

<p>However, it did. More than once tears wet
her pillow at night while she lay and wondered
why Larry had forsaken her. She did not believe
it could be the seven years’ difference in their
ages.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if he does think me a little girl,”
she told herself; “he might, at least, be polite.”</p>

<p>But, in truth, she laid the defection of Larry
Haven to his mother. The why of this was no
more clear to her girlish mind than Larry’s neglect;
but she had felt Mrs. Haven’s antagonism so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
deeply that she could not fail to take it into consideration
now.</p>

<p>Beth was one of those loyal souls who seldom
make friends save after due consideration, and
who cling to their friendships, once made, through
fair weather and foul. She felt about Larry just
as she would have felt about an older brother.
He was just as necessary to her complete happiness
as Marcus was.</p>

<p>After their intimate talk at the party, Beth felt
that her mind and Larry’s were a good deal in accord—especially
on the question of the advancement
of her schooling. So she hoped he would
continue to show his interest in the wonderful (to
her) prospect of Rivercliff. She had no assurance
that Larry even knew she was surely going
to school until the afternoon came for her departure
from Hudsonvale.</p>

<p>It was an event, indeed, for one of the Baldwins
to go away by the river boat. The <i>Water
Wagtail</i> was one of the finest of the fleet plying
up and down the Nessing River, and Mr. Baldwin
had obtained for Beth one of the staterooms for
the trip.</p>

<p>The county paper, which ran a page of Hudsonvale
news (“in spite of Mary Devine,” Mr.
Baldwin said), had printed a note of Beth’s proposed
departure for school, and the date. Was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
that how Larry knew? For when Beth went down
to the dock and aboard the <i>Water Wagtail</i>, the
steward had just taken a box of cut flowers to her
stateroom.</p>

<p>“I declare for’t, Missy,” said the shining-faced
negro, “yo’ friend suttenly has sent yo’ a heap o’
posies.”</p>

<p>“Let me see the card, steward,” she said
quickly.</p>

<p>It was Larry’s, and Beth knew that flowers like
these grew only in his mother’s garden—in Hudsonvale,
at least.</p>

<p>Her family had trooped aboard after her—with
Mary Devine and a dozen other girls who
had been Beth’s friends at the high school. They
made a noisy and jolly party. And how they wondered
and exclaimed over the flower-filled stateroom.</p>

<p>“Why!” cried Mary Devine, “it’s just like a
bridal tour you’re starting on. Aren’t you lucky,
B. B.?”</p>

<p>“I surely am,” admitted Beth, smiling.</p>

<p>“But where’s the groom?” asked one of the
other girls, slily. “Did he send the flowers?”</p>

<p>“How ridiculous!” rejoined Mary, scornfully.
“It’s the best man who sends the flowers, not the
groom. He has to help smell ’em!”</p>

<p>The party remained on deck while the freight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
was being run aboard below. Beth’s glance often
swept the littered dock as she talked gaily to her
friends or to the children or to her mother and
father. Suddenly her eyes fixed their gaze upon a
tall figure striding down to the dock from Water
Street.</p>

<p>It was Larry. Beth’s heart leaped and the color
came and went in her cheeks. Had there not been
so much going on, her excitement must have been
noticed. As it happened, however, not even the
girls chanced to see Larry till he was aboard the
boat and was approaching the group.</p>

<p>By that time Beth had quite regained her self-control.
She welcomed Larry with just the degree
of warmth her mother displayed—by no
means as joyfully as did Mary Devine. He had
to be introduced to the other girls—re-introduced
in some cases. With Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin he
was delightfully cordial. The children—even the
twins—welcomed Larry nicely. Nothing was said
about his previous neglect.</p>

<p>When the warning whistle sounded and the
party arose to leave, Larry manoeuvered to get
Beth by herself for a moment. They took the
outer deck on one side of the glass-enclosed cabin,
while the rest of the party went the other way to
the stair-well.</p>

<p>“Go to it, Beth. I glory in your resolve,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Larry said, in reference to her plunge into boarding-school
life. “Get all there is for you at
Rivercliff.”</p>

<p>“I mean to, Larry,” she said composedly. “And
thank you for the flowers—they are beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they were the Mater’s idea,” he said hurriedly.
“But I have something here——”</p>

<p>He fumbled in his pocket and brought forth a
little box—a jeweler’s box, Beth knew.</p>

<p>“You won’t want to wear those jolly old corals
that belonged to your Great-grandmother Lomis
at every party you go to up there,” Larry said,
more boyish in his confusion than ever, Beth
thought. “Here’s something you can wear right
along—to remember me by.”</p>

<p>He thrust the box into her hand. The children
came racing to join them. Beth hid the box
quickly in her bag—she knew not why.</p>

<p>She pressed Larry’s hand in farewell. She
kissed her mother, her father, and “all the tribe,”
as Ella called the family. The girls waved their
handkerchiefs from the shore.</p>

<p>Larry did not wait as the <i>Water Wagtail</i>
pulled out into the stream. It was his tall form,
however, striding up the dock when the steamboat
was really under way that Beth last saw.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>AN ADVENTURE IN MIDSTREAM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth</span> had left the door of her stateroom wide
open. When she went into the passage out of
which it opened, she saw a girl looking in at the
flowers, admiringly.</p>

<p>She was a merry-eyed girl, with short, fine,
brown hair that had been blown about her face
by the fresh, river breeze. This fact made her
seem a little untidy; but she had a winning smile,
was well dressed, and Beth found herself interested
in the stranger even before the merry one
spoke.</p>

<p>“How jolly!” she cried. “You certainly must
have heaps and heaps of friends.”</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked Beth, demurely.</p>

<p>“Because they’ve just about filled your room
with flowers. Or were they so glad to see you go
that they over-speeded the parting guest?” added
the girl, roguishly.</p>

<p>Beth laughed as she went by the other into the
room and seized a bunch of roses. “Here,” she
said, thrusting the flowers into the strange girl’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
hands. “I must divide with somebody. And my
friends were not speeding the parting guest. I am
going to school.”</p>

<p>“Bless us! so am I,” said the other, burying her
rather retroussé nose in the fragrant blossoms.
“But they didn’t waste any lovely flowers on poor
little Molly—nay, nay, Pauline!”</p>

<p>“My name is not ‘Pauline,’” interposed Beth,
her eyes dancing. “It’s Beth.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how jolly!” cried the other. “I never
knew a girl named Beth outside of a story-book.”</p>

<p>“It’s my real name,” Beth said demurely.</p>

<p>“And are you going to school?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Not to Rivercliff?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am,” Beth said, her own eagerness increasing.
“Are you?”</p>

<p>“How jolly!” ejaculated this rather exclamatory
girl. “I certainly am going to Miss ’Ammersly’s
hestablishment, as it would have been
called in ‘dear hold Hengland,’ had she remained
there to conduct her school.”</p>

<p>“Oh! is the principal English?” asked Beth.</p>

<p>“The nicest kind. And Madam Hammersly!
Wait till you see her! She wears the cunningest
caps.”</p>

<p>“Who is she?” asked the puzzled Beth.</p>

<p>“Miss Hammersly’s mother. And such a dear!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
She is really the housekeeper and general manager—and,
oh! so particular! No end! But she’s
a jolly old dear, at that.”</p>

<p>Beth saw that this girl overworked at least one
word in the English language. But it was impossible
to look at her without thinking of that very
word. She was jolly, indeed.</p>

<p>Naturally, Beth Baldwin was greatly interested
in this, the first of her future schoolmates whom
she met and not a little curious about her. She
learned at once that Molly Granger had been to
Rivercliff for two years already, having entered
what Miss Hammersly called the “primary department.”</p>

<p>“But I shall be a full-fledged first-grade with
you ‘freshies’ this fall. I shall be in your classes,”
she said cheerfully. “I believe I am going to like
you a lot, Beth. And that’s more than I can say
for some of the girls who have been with me as
‘primes’ and now will be in our grade too. There’s
Maude Grimshaw, for instance. <i>That</i> girl would
try the patience of a Jobess.”</p>

<p>“A <i>what</i>?” gasped Beth.</p>

<p>“A Jobess. Female for Job. Isn’t that right?”
asked Molly, her eyes dancing.</p>

<p>Beth laughed. Then she said suddenly:</p>

<p>“Oh, wait!” and, seizing some more of the
flowers from Mrs. Euphemia Haven’s garden, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
darted out of the stateroom. She had been watching
for several moments a girl who stood in plain
view in the cabin and who had been staring at the
flowers.</p>

<p>She was a slim, freckled girl, rather oddly
dressed, Beth thought; but her big, dark eyes expressed
a longing for the flowers that could not be
mistaken.</p>

<p>“You’ll have some, won’t you?” demanded
Beth, offering the flowers to this stranger, as she
had to Molly Granger. “I have so many of
them!”</p>

<p>Then she realized that the freckled girl’s eyes
were blue. A shadow seemed to lift from them
as she smiled. Whereas they had been dusky before,
they shone as she looked first at the flowers
and then at Beth.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” she said, and her voice was
delightfully gentle—“cultured,” Beth would have
said, had that expression not so badly fitted the
strange girl’s appearance. She wore a very odd
combination of garments.</p>

<p>Her smile and her speech repaid Beth for her
act. The freckled-faced girl crossed the cabin—she
walked gracefully—and sat down upon a divan
with the flowers. Before Beth turned back to
her new friend, Molly Granger, the blue eyes had
become clouded again and the tall figure of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
girl drooped over the handful of flowers. Beth
whispered to Molly:</p>

<p>“I wonder who she is?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t the first idea,” said the jolly girl,
carelessly.</p>

<p>“Do you think she is going to school with us?”</p>

<p>“To Rivercliff? I should say not!” gasped
Molly. “Say! you don’t know what you’re up
against there, Beth. Why, we girls of Rivercliff
stand for the ‘acme of style.’ The only magazines
we read are the fashion magazines—and we only
look at the pictures in those. Maude Grimshaw
could wear diamonds to each class recitation—and
royal ermine, I presume, too—whatever that
is,” and Molly laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Beth, greatly taken aback.</p>

<p>“Only, you see, Miss Hammersly won’t have
it. She is for plain frocks in school. What the
girls wear in the evenings or on holidays does not
so much bother her. We’re all supposed to be
from families who roll in wealth—whatever that
may mean,” and Molly giggled again.</p>

<p>“Are—are <i>you</i>?” asked Beth, somewhat timidly.</p>

<p>“Am I what, my dear?” returned Molly.</p>

<p>“From a rich family?”</p>

<p>“Goodness, no! My aunts send me to Rivercliff.
I’m a poor, lone orphan. My poor, dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
mother must have taken one look at me, have seen
what an awful, ugly little sprite I was, and thankfully
ceased to live. My father was a missionary
and died of fever in Canton. There you have my
history, saving that seven aunts—all my father’s
sisters (do you wonder he went missionarying?)—took
upon themselves the task of bringing up and
educating ‘poor lil’ Molly.’ If I hadn’t a well
developed sense of the ridiculous, it would have
killed me long ago.”</p>

<p>Molly rattled on so recklessly that Beth was
more than a little startled at first. Then it began
to impress the girl from Hudsonvale that here
was a person who had really never had a mother
or a father, and had never learned the actual need
of parents. Therefore, she could talk so indifferently
about them.</p>

<p>Another thought was, however, buzzing in
Beth’s brain.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose these wealthy girls at
Rivercliff will say to my dresses?” she asked.
“I’ve only one better than this—and that’s for
evening wear.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! How long is a string?” demanded
the other girl.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“How long is a string?” repeated Molly, laughing.
“You might as well ask me that as to ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
me how Maude Grimshaw and that tribe will look
on you and your clothes. And I guess there’s no
answer to that old wheeze.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes there is,” said Beth, laughing too.
“My sister Ella says the answer is ‘from here to
there.’”</p>

<p>It did not take much to keep these two new
friends laughing. And, at the moment, it did not
seem a great trouble to Beth whether the wealthy
girls at Rivercliff liked her and her clothes or not.</p>

<p>She carried most of Larry’s donation of flowers
out into the cabin and told the stewardess to
arrange them on one of the writing tables. Then
she locked her stateroom door and went with
Molly on a tour of the boat.</p>

<p>“You see, I’ve been up and down the river on
this boat a dozen times,” said the jolly orphan.
“I come from Hambro, ’way down the river. I
started early this morning. We’ll get to the Rivercliff
landing to-morrow evening—if the freight
traffic isn’t too heavy. The <i>Water Wagtail</i> staggers
from one side to the other of the river, picking
up freight at the landings, and sometimes the
trip is delayed long beyond sched. But never
mind! school doesn’t really open till Monday.
We’ve got three perfectly good days before us.”</p>

<p>Twice Beth noticed the freckled girl as they
passed through the cabin. She still sat in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
melancholy attitude, and the flowers had dropped
into her lap. Beth knew she must be in some
trouble or sorrow; but she scarcely saw how she
could help the stranger.</p>

<p>Molly Granger kept up a running fire of comment
upon everybody and everything. The steamboat
stopped at two small towns before dark,
and the new chums watched the busy scenes on the
docks and talked about the new faces they saw.
Beth found Molly the very best of company; for
while she was light-hearted and full of fun and
mischief, she was sound at the root and had no unkindness
or meanness in her make-up. Indeed,
Beth Baldwin had never met one of her own age
before whom she liked so well on such short acquaintance.</p>

<p>Left to herself for a short while, Beth was going
over in her mind all the adventures of this busy
and exciting day. How much had happened—and
how much unexpected—since she had started
from the little cottage on Bemis Street.</p>

<p>Then, for the very first time since she had
slipped it into her bag, Beth thought of Larry’s
present. Something in a jeweler’s box! How had
she forgotten it for so long?</p>

<p>“That proves that this has been an exciting
time,” murmured the girl, getting her bag and
opening it. “Ah! here is the box.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>It was neatly wrapped and tied, and her fingers
were engaged in untying the string for a minute
or so. Then she opened the box. A puffy mass of
pink cotton met her gaze. She pulled this aside.</p>

<p>“Oh! O-o-o-oh!” she breathed. “The beauty!
The <i>beauty</i>!”</p>

<p>She took out the pin. It was delicately wrought
of platinum and studded with diamond chips and
tiny half-pearls. It was not very expensive; but
it showed skilled workmanship and was an ornament
that would surely attract attention. Yet it
was simple enough to look well if worn by a young
girl.</p>

<p>Larry Haven’s taste could not be criticized. If
he had selected the pin himself (and Beth believed
he had, from what he had said at its presentation),
it showed that he thought of her—that he
still considered Beth his little friend and comrade.</p>

<p>Yet, if so, why had he neglected coming to the
Bemis Street cottage all summer? This still puzzled
and troubled the girl.</p>

<p>At supper time Beth and Molly went up to the
saloon deck and the captain of the waiters found
the two friends seats at a pleasant table. Beth
looked for the freckled girl but did not see her.
Yet Beth was sure she had not gone ashore at
either of the landings.</p>

<p>While the girls ate and enjoyed their supper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
a mist arose and enfolded the steamboat and enshrouded
the face of the river. When they came
out on the open deck again, the clammy breath
of the mist fanned their cheeks, and all they could
see of the banks on either hand were occasional
twinkling lights—either on scattered farmsteads
or in tiny villages or ferry-houses.</p>

<p>“B-r-r-r-r! It’s going to be a nasty night,” said
Molly Granger. “I shall go to bed early. No
fun sitting up unless the moon shines. Then it is
lovely to be out here and watch the shores. The
old steamer won’t stop again till we reach Marbury—about
midnight.”</p>

<p>“I was hoping for a moonlit night,” said Beth,
disappointedly.</p>

<p>“Better to get a good sleep, for to-morrow will
be a long day,” said Molly, showing a streak of
good sense that Beth had not known she possessed.
“We may not get to bed to-morrow night till late;
for we may be delayed in reaching Rivercliff. I’ve
been as late as eleven o’clock getting off this boat
at that landing.”</p>

<p>“I guess you know best, Molly,” agreed Beth.</p>

<p>But she was not sleepy herself—not even when
Molly bade her a warm good-night and went into
her own stateroom, which was not far from Beth’s.
The latter encircled the outer main deck again.
The <i>Water Wagtail</i> was in midstream. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
a side-wheeler, and the splashing of her buckets
and the creak of her walking-beam, added to the
hiss! hiss! of the spray from overside, played an
accompaniment to Beth’s thoughts.</p>

<p>Her first night away from home! Never had
she slept from under her parents’ roof before.
Her own little room, shared with Ella, was the
only chamber in which the girl had ever spent the
night.</p>

<p>Little wonder that she felt nervous, if not apprehensive.
There were two berths in her room—an
upper and lower. She would have been glad
to share the stateroom with Molly Granger; but
she shrank from admitting to even that easy-going,
jolly chum that she felt the need of company at
night.</p>

<p>She shrank, too, from going to her stateroom
and locking herself in.</p>

<p>Instead, she wandered about the boat again.
She spent more than two hours going from deck
to deck—sitting a while in one place, then getting
up and wandering about, wrapped well in her raincoat
to keep out the thick mist.</p>

<p>Several times she saw the freckled-faced girl.
Either she had no stateroom, or else, with Beth,
she did not feel like going to it. And her expression
of countenance and deeply despondent manner
troubled the girl from Hudsonvale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“I wish I could do something for her,” thought
Beth. “She must be poverty poor with that get-up.
Dear me! I haven’t any too much money
myself; but if a little would help her——”</p>

<p>She finally started toward the strange girl,
determined to accost her; but just then the latter
arose from her seat and approached one of the
uniformed officers of the boat, then just passing
through the cabin.</p>

<p>“Are we near Brakelock, yet?” Beth heard the
girl ask.</p>

<p>“We’re not far from that landing, Miss; but
we stop there only on the down trip unless we’re
signalled to take passengers. Nothing doing to-night,
Miss.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the girl, quietly.</p>

<p>The man went about his business. The girl
immediately descended the stairs to the lower, or
freight, deck. Beth, hesitating whether she should
speak to her or not, followed unobserved.</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to be about. The way was
open aft to the outer deck behind the paddle-wheels.
The tall girl went swiftly to the port
side, slid open one of the doors, and stepped out
upon the misty, open deck. Beth went out by another
door. There was nobody aft but herself and
that other girl—not another soul.</p>

<p>The girl did not see Beth and the latter hesitated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
again. What should she say to her? How
accost her?</p>

<p>And then—the discovery set Beth’s heart to
beating madly—she saw that the strange girl was
leaning far over the rail of this lower deck, so
close below which the black water hissed and
gurgled. In a moment she had a knee upon the
flat top of the rail, flinging up her tight skirts with
an impatient kick to free her limbs of their entanglement.</p>

<p>She was teetering—almost head downward—on
the rail, about—it seemed—to plunge into the
swift current of the river!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>CYNTHIA FOGG</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth</span> had learned something about vigorous
play at basket-ball under the direction of the instructor
in physical culture at the Hudsonvale high
school. Besides, she had not played with Marcus
and the other boys—even with Larry in years gone
by—without learning what is meant by a low
tackle.</p>

<p>So, when she jumped for the girl who seemed
about to throw herself into the river from the
stern of the <i>Water Wagtail</i>, she “tackled low.”
She seized the reckless girl about her knees, locking
her legs tightly in her arms.</p>

<p>“You can’t! I sha’n’t let you!” Beth gasped, as
the other struggled. “Oh! what a wicked thing
you are doing!”</p>

<p>The freckled girl squealed—no other word
could exactly express the startled sound she made
when Beth seized her. Then she attempted to
turn around and face her rescuer, as the latter
dragged her down and away from the rail.</p>

<p>“What are you doing? Stop it!” sputtered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
tall girl. “Goodness! how strong you are! Do
let me be!”</p>

<p>“I won’t!” cried the excited Beth. “I won’t!
You sha’n’t do such a dreadful thing! I’ll shout
for help!”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t do that,” begged the other girl.
“They’ll do something awful to me.”</p>

<p>“Then promise you won’t do <i>that</i>——”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“It would be dreadful——”</p>

<p>“What would be dreadful?” repeated the
strange girl, in some heat. “They’d have got the
boat back again. I wasn’t going to steal it.”</p>

<p>“Steal it?” murmured Beth, startled and confused.</p>

<p>“Yes. I’d have left it tied along shore there.
No harm would have come to it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear!” gasped Beth. “Is there a boat
there?”</p>

<p>“Of course there is. Didn’t you see it dragging
just astern? They forgot to hoist it in. I noticed
it before dark. Say!” exclaimed the other, her
strange eyes suddenly shining in the mist as she
stared at Beth. “What did you think I was trying
to do when I was hauling in on that painter?”</p>

<p>“I—I thought you wanted to drown yourself,”
whispered the confused Beth.</p>

<p>“My aunt!” exclaimed the girl, and laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
shortly. “No. I’m not quite so desperate as all
that.”</p>

<p>“But you might fall overboard getting into that
boat,” said Beth.</p>

<p>“I can swim. But the current’s swift here in
midstream,” and she shuddered. “Now you’ve
knocked the courage all out of me. Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“Why do you want to leave the boat in such a
crazy fashion?” demanded Beth, regaining her
self-possession.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get away before the <i>Water Wagtail</i>
stops at Marbury,” said the other, hastily.</p>

<p>“Why?” repeated Beth.</p>

<p>“Oh—because!”</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t dare take that boat. You
might fall overboard from it. You would be lost
in this fog,” Beth urged.</p>

<p>“I know. I wouldn’t dare now,” said the other,
gloomily.</p>

<p>“If I hadn’t stopped you something dreadful
might have happened.”</p>

<p>“Nothing more dreadful than will happen when
we reach Marbury.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked the curious and
sympathetic Beth.</p>

<p>“They know I am on this boat,” confessed the
girl, with sudden desperation. “And they’ll come
aboard of her and take me back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“Back where?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you. It’s awful! I haven’t a living
soul I can call my own—not a real relative——”</p>

<p>“You are an orphan?” asked Beth, thinking at
once of an asylum or an institution to which she
supposed poor girls without parents or relatives
have to go. Besides, the awful clothing this girl
wore bore out this supposition of Beth’s—that
she had run away from a charitable establishment
of some kind.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’m an orphan,” said the other girl,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Can’t I help you?” suggested the sympathetic
Beth.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“What is your name, please?” asked Beth.
“Mine is Beth Baldwin.”</p>

<p>“Cynthia—Cynthia Fogg,” mumbled the other
girl, and so hesitatingly that Beth half believed
that the last name, at least, was born of the thick
river mist out into which the wonderful blue eyes
were staring. Nevertheless, Beth said nothing to
betray her doubt.</p>

<p>“You say these—these people will search the
boat for you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“People from the—the institution from which
you have run away?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Cynthia turned her head quickly so that Beth
could no longer see her face, replying in a muffled
tone: “Yes; from the institution.”</p>

<p>“How do you know they are on board?” continued
the practical Beth.</p>

<p>“Somebody that knows me saw me at that last
landing—just as the steamboat was pulling out,”
replied Cynthia. “I know he’ll telephone up the
river to Marbury. And I’ll never get away from
them now.”</p>

<p>“You may escape them,” said Beth, kindly.
When Cynthia looked back at the dragging boat,
she added hastily: “Oh, not by that means. There
must be a less perilous way.”</p>

<p>Without any thought of the possible consequences,
Beth had given her heart and hand to
the strange girl’s cause. It meant little to her that
this girl had run away from some public institution.
She did not stop to ask why she had run
away.</p>

<p>“How, I’d like you to tell me?” said Cynthia.</p>

<p>“Surely those who look for you will not arouse
the passengers and make a disturbance in the middle
of the night? We don’t get to Marbury till
midnight, I understand.”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the generous Beth, “why not come
to my stateroom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Yours? Why! you don’t know me,” said the
other girl, rather astounded.</p>

<p>“Surely, we’ve just introduced ourselves,”
laughed Beth. “I am alone in my stateroom.
There are two berths. They’ll never look for
you there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my aunt!” ejaculated Cynthia Fogg, with
such sudden animation, that her strange eyes
sparkled again. “That would be great!”</p>

<p>Beth thought the girl an odd combination of
characteristics. One moment she was morose;
the next she brightened up and was all life and
gaiety. But the girl from Hudsonvale was bent
only on helping Cynthia.</p>

<p>“Will you come to my room?” she repeated.</p>

<p>“Surely I will—if you think they’ll let me.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Why, the steamboat people,” said Cynthia.</p>

<p>“I guess they won’t stop us. But we’d better
not let anybody see us together. When the boat
gets to Marbury, somebody may remember having
seen you with me, and then they’ll suspect where
you are hidden,” said the practical Beth.</p>

<p>“My aunt! so they will,” admitted Cynthia.</p>

<p>“So we’ll go singly. Don’t let the stewardess
see you,” said Beth, warningly. “I’ll go first.
You’ll surely follow?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” said the other girl, warmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“And no trying to go overboard—into a boat
or not?” added Beth, smiling.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid now,” confessed the other. “You’ve
scared me.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll take care of you,” promised Beth,
laughing again.</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> a nice little thing,” repeated Cynthia
Fogg.</p>

<p>“Thank you. My room is Number Fifty-three.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said the other. “I saw those flowers.
I’ll wait till you get there before I come upstairs.”</p>

<p>Beth re-entered the enclosed part of the boat
and went up to the main deck at once. She had
been in her stateroom ten minutes before she
heard a quiet little rustle outside her door. She
had left it unlocked, but now she turned the knob
invitingly.</p>

<p>The freckled girl pushed it open and glided in,
closing it noiselessly behind her.</p>

<p>“Here I am,” she said.</p>

<small>QUEER TALK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dress of this unfortunate in whose fate
Beth had taken such a strong interest, had already
made the girl from Hudsonvale wonder. Such
a shocking combination of color and tawdry finery
Beth had seldom seen, even in a mill village, which
Hudsonvale was.</p>

<p>Yet the tall, freckled girl wore the incongruous
garments with utter unconsciousness. She never
seemed to give her dress a thought.</p>

<p>On a green straw hat of the season’s mode, was
a purple feather, which had plainly seen service in
the rain. She wore a ragged feather boa and a
rather soiled brown silk waist much worn under
the arms and evidently originally built for a much
fuller figure.</p>

<p>A black serge skirt of very narrow proportions
seemed shrunk upon her, and was spotted and
shiny. Low brown shoes and spats completed the
costume.</p>

<p>“I suppose these awful garments are better than
the uniform of the institution she fled from,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
thought Beth. Then she asked aloud: “What did
you think of doing when you ran away?”</p>

<p>Cynthia’s face blossomed into one of her unexpected
smiles. “Just thinking of running away,”
she said.</p>

<p>“But how did you propose to live?” asked the
practical Beth.</p>

<p>“By drawing my breath—the same as usual,”
and the strange girl went off into a spasm of
laughter which Beth thought showed rather poor
taste to say the least.</p>

<p>“But we all must do something besides breathing
to live,” she said shortly.</p>

<p>“True,” said Cynthia. “Eat. And to eat we
must have money, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Beth, still with gravity.</p>

<p>“I intend to work,” said the older girl, composedly
enough now.</p>

<p>“What kind of work can you do?”</p>

<p>Cynthia hesitated. She put her head on one
side. Her eyes grew dark and unfathomable
again.</p>

<p>“I ought to get a job at housework, oughtn’t I?”
she said.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Beth, thoughtfully.
“Wherever you apply for work you will have a
better chance of obtaining it if you look—look a
little more like other girls, don’t you think?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“What?” questioned Cynthia, evidently puzzled.</p>

<p>“Why—your dress, I mean. Perhaps we can
help you make your appearance nicer.”</p>

<p>“You mean my clothes are ugly?” asked Cynthia,
bluntly.</p>

<p>“And not altogether clean,” added Beth,
quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, housemaids don’t have to dress very
fancy, do they?” demanded the refugee. “I got
these things I am wearing from a girl who worked
as a maid and waitress, and I paid—— Well! I
paid enough for them.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” mused Beth, “you couldn’t risk
going out on the street in your uniform.”</p>

<p>“My what?” exclaimed Cynthia.</p>

<p>“Why—uniform. Didn’t you all dress alike in
that place where you were?”</p>

<p>Cynthia turned her face from Beth suddenly.
“Oh—yes,” she said, in a muffled tone. “I see. I
just had to get different clothes.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe we can fix you up a little better.”</p>

<p>“Who’s ‘we?’” demanded Cynthia, quickly and
sharply.</p>

<p>“There is a friend here who is going to school
too.”</p>

<p>“Are you on your way to school?” asked Cynthia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Yes,” Beth replied.</p>

<p>“What school?”</p>

<p>“Rivercliff.”</p>

<p>“And is that other girl I saw you with?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We had just met. She is an awfully
nice girl. Maybe she can help.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? To give me some of
your clothes? Bless you, child!” and this strange
girl laughed heartily. “Both of you are chunky
and I am tall. Your clothes never would fit me
in the world. I don’t want skirts half way to my
knees. Make me look like a giraffe reaching for
the highest branches of a cocoanut palm!”</p>

<p>She laughed again, and Beth joined her—but
rather ruefully. To tell the truth, Beth thought
her strangely particular for a poor girl—a runaway
from an orphans’ home, or something of the
kind.</p>

<p>But she did not prolong the argument with her
guest. Cynthia Fogg (if such was her name) was
frankly yawning.</p>

<p>“We will talk of it in the morning,” Beth said,
with sympathy. “I see you are tired. You may
take either berth——”</p>

<p>“Oh! I could never climb into an upper,”
gasped Cynthia. “If I have to sleep in such a
place it has to be in the lower berth.”</p>

<p>Evidently the runaway was used to taking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
best there was to be had—whatever that best
might be. She seemed quite careless of other
people’s needs or desires. She took Beth’s kindness
in offering her the choice of the berths quite
as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Naturally, there was not much room in the
stateroom for two people. Cynthia seemed so
tired that Beth sat back on a stool and allowed
her to undress first. The girl from Hudsonvale
could not help noticing that the stranger’s under-clothing
was very good and spotlessly clean.
These did not match her outside apparel in the
least. Beth Baldwin could not help but think this
strange.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t suppose I’d be sleeping in a
stateroom to-night,” said Cynthia, with a careless
laugh, as she got into the wider lower berth. “I
didn’t have much money left after I bought these
clothes of that girl.”</p>

<p>Beth wanted to ask how she had obtained money
at all at the orphan asylum; but she did not wish
to appear too curious. Perhaps they allowed the
girls there to earn money by outside work. Cynthia
spoke as though she had been bred to domestic
service.</p>

<p>Beth, who was not unobservant, had looked
more than once at the strange girl’s hands. They
were white and soft, well kept, and slenderly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
formed—not at all the hands of a girl who had
dabbled in dish-water or used the mop and scrubbing
brush. Her clean-cut features, too, and her
low, cultivated voice, certainly belied the thought
that she had spent her life in domestic service.</p>

<p>Beth began slowly to coil her hair for the night,
having slipped out of her shirt waist. Cynthia
blinked at her for a moment, yawned twice (showing
very even, strong looking teeth, likewise perfectly
kept) and then—deep, even breathing from
the lower berth warned the other girl that Cynthia
was asleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>RIVERCLIFF LANDING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth</span> was roused from her reverie by the
mournful tooting of the <i>Water Wagtail’s</i> whistle
for the landing at Marbury. Here Cynthia Fogg
expected her pursuers would come aboard to
search the boat for her; but she was a sound
sleeper and did not arouse at all while the steamer
was at the dock, discharging and receiving freight.</p>

<p>Nor did Beth hear anything outside her stateroom
door that indicated a search of the passengers’
quarters for the runaway girl. Beth was a
little worried, now she stopped to think of the
matter more seriously. What would the authorities
do to her if it was learned that she had hidden
Cynthia away?</p>

<p>She wondered about another thing, too. If
Cynthia safely escaped her pursuers, what was to
be done with her? Beth wondered whether or not
she should take Molly Granger into the secret.
She felt that she ought to advise with somebody,
and Molly seemed the only person at hand.</p>

<p>Yet she realized that the laughing, joking, careless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Molly might not be just the best sort of individual
to advise with in any important emergency.</p>

<p>Somehow, Beth felt that Cynthia Fogg was one
of those persons who are apt to trust implicitly in
the suggestions or help of others rather than themselves
exert mind or body in an emergency. Having
given herself into Beth’s hands, the runaway
had gone to sleep as peacefully as a baby, leaving
her hostess to think out her future course—if she
would.</p>

<p>The steamboat finally got under way again, and
nobody disturbed the occupants of stateroom
Number 53. Beth then undressed, said her prayers,
put Larry’s present and her purse under her
pillow, and climbed gingerly into bed, being careful
not to awaken the slumbering Cynthia.</p>

<p>She did not expect to sleep much, the situation
being so strange and the day such an exciting one.
But scarcely was her head comfortably settled on
the pillow than she was off.</p>

<p>One o’clock was a late hour for Beth Baldwin
to be awake. Therefore, the early morning stir
upon the boat—even its stopping at several small
landings—did not arouse her. But a fist pounding
vigorously on the door of Number 53 did finally
awaken her.</p>

<p>“Beth Baldwin! Beth Baldwin! For the sake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
of goodness! Do you die at night and have to
be resurrected every morning?”</p>

<p>“Is—is that you, Molly Granger?” yawned
Beth.</p>

<p>“It is. Get up!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it <i>dreadfully</i> early?”</p>

<p>“No. It’s only cloudy. The day is broke, my
child—dead broke, by the looks of it, I should
say. A nasty day! and I so wanted it to be nice.”</p>

<p>Beth had reached down and was fumbling at
the key in the lock. Now she turned it and Molly
bounced in.</p>

<p>“Well! you lazy girl!” cried Miss Granger, who
was fully dressed. “You’ll learn to get up more
promptly than this at Rivercliff. Miss Hammersly
believes in early hours. So does the
madam.”</p>

<p>“I did not go to sleep till after the boat left
Marbury,” said Beth, yawning frankly again.</p>

<p>“Mercy! and I never even knew we stopped
there,” laughed Molly. Then suddenly she uttered
a suppressed shriek and fell back from the
berths.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded the startled
Beth, sitting up wildly and bumping her head.</p>

<p>“What—what’s <i>that</i>?” asked the other girl,
pointing.</p>

<p>“Oh! Ow! Ouch!” groaned Beth, placing both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
hands tenderly on her poor, bruised crown.
“What is the matter with you, Molly Granger?”</p>

<p>Then she remembered Cynthia Fogg and carefully
crept down from her berth. In the lower
berth, the freckled runaway was wound up in the
blanket like an Egyptian mummy in its wrappings,
quite unconscious of what was going on about her.</p>

<p>“For mercy’s sake!” repeated Molly. “Did
that grow there in the night?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear me, no!” gasped Beth, between laughing
and weeping, for the bump hurt. “That’s
Cynthia.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Cynthia Fogg.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! Did you have her in your bag?
Was that why I didn’t see her before?” asked
Molly Granger.</p>

<p>“Why—don’t you see? It’s the girl I gave
flowers to. Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>Molly was staring wonderingly about the stateroom.
She spied the green hat and purple
feather.</p>

<p>“Cracky-me!” she sighed. “That dowdy?”</p>

<p>“Sh!” began Beth, but Molly interrupted:</p>

<p>“She’s dead, isn’t she? Nothing less than Gabriel’s
trump will wake her up. Tell me about it—do!
A strange girl in your stateroom? I
shouldn’t have thought you’d dare.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“Why—I never thought there was the least
harm in her,” Beth said, wonderingly. “And she
was in trouble.”</p>

<p>“What sort of trouble?”</p>

<p>In whispers Beth told Molly all about it. The
jolly girl laughed when she heard how Beth
thought the freckled girl was about to commit suicide;
but she listened to the remainder of the story
with some seriousness.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you dared do it,” repeated
Molly. “To take her right into your stateroom!”</p>

<p>“But she’s only a girl like ourselves.”</p>

<p>“But from a public institution of some kind!”</p>

<p>“Is that different from a boarding school?” demanded
Beth, with some warmth. “Only the girls,
I suppose, are all poor and don’t have very much
fun.”</p>

<p>“Cracky-me!” exclaimed Molly again. “Maybe
she’s from some place where they send really bad
girls. Perhaps she’s escaped from a reform
school.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” laughed Beth. “She’s nicely
spoken and is very ladylike. And has such wonderful
eyes!”</p>

<p>“I noticed those eyes last evening,” said Molly,
reflectively. “And she is older than we are.”</p>

<p>“Not much.”</p>

<p>“Maybe she has been with people who are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
nice. To think of the risk you took, Beth Baldwin!
And she admitted the authorities were after
her.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Suppose a policeman had come right here to
this room and demanded her—and taken you to
jail, too?”</p>

<p>But Molly’s eyes twinkled, and Beth laughed
again. “You can’t scare me, Molly Granger. I
don’t believe there is a mite of harm in Cynthia
Fogg.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to do with ‘Cynthia-of-the-minute?’”
asked Molly.</p>

<p>“That’s what I want to talk to you about,”
said Beth, seriously.</p>

<p>“With me? Goodness! Am I going to be in
this?”</p>

<p>“Of course. We’re chums, aren’t we?” laughed
Beth, roguishly, as she drew on her stockings.
“Sit down on the edge of the berth, Molly, and
we’ll talk. I don’t think Cynthia means to wake
up.”</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t awaken if the upper berth fell
down,” declared Molly Granger. “Well now!
what is it, Beth Baldwin? I believe you are going
to get me into trouble.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. But we both must help this
poor girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“Why must we? I don’t like that word, anyway,”
confessed Molly.</p>

<p>“But if we can help folks in this world, we
ought to, oughtn’t we?”</p>

<p>“That is, if we find a convict, for instance, escaping,
we should aid him rather than the police?”
giggled Molly.</p>

<p>“Hush! I tell you I have every confidence in
Cynthia’s being a good girl. But she is a poor
girl, and she needs some better looking clothes
than those she has. And then, she needs work.”</p>

<p>“What kind of work?” asked Molly, wide-eyed.
“We couldn’t find her work to do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether we could or not. She
speaks as though she were used to domestic service.”</p>

<p>But Beth refrained from mentioning the fact
that the appearance of Cynthia’s hands did not
bear this out.</p>

<p>“Might introduce her to Madam Hammersly,”
said Molly, really thinking about the situation
now. “She is always hiring and discharging maids
and waitresses. She is awfully particular.”</p>

<p>“But we’d want to get Cynthia a permanent position,”
said Beth.</p>

<p>“Oh! if the madam liked her—if this girl could
suit her—she would have a good situation.
Madam pays well, I believe,” said Molly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>Just then the bundle of blankets on the berth
began to heave, and a voice came from out of it,
saying:</p>

<p>“’Nuff said! I take the job! Ow—yow! yow!
Is it morning? Who’s this girl sitting on me, anyway?”</p>

<p>Molly got up in a hurry. Beth laughed, saying
to the girl in the berth:</p>

<p>“How do you know the position will suit you,
Cynthia?”</p>

<p>“Why, any position suits one if one has no
money—isn’t that so?” said the philosophical one.
Her clear, low voice made Molly think more favorably
of her—the jolly girl showed this in her
expression of countenance.</p>

<p>“How jolly!” she exclaimed, and throwing all
her previous caution to the winds. “It would be
great fun to take you to Rivercliff with us.”</p>

<p>“To school, you mean?” yawned Cynthia Fogg.</p>

<p>“To school. But to work for Madam Hammersly.
She is housekeeper and general manager.
Why! there are twenty or more girls on her staff.”</p>

<p>“They don’t have to take lessons, do they?”
demanded Cynthia, apparently rather startled by
the idea.</p>

<p>“Oh no!” giggled Molly. “I should say not.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m willing to try it,” said Cynthia,
swinging her slender limbs out of bed. “But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Miss Baldwin, you didn’t tell me this girl’s name?”</p>

<p>“So I didn’t. Pardon!” said Beth. “Miss
Granger.”</p>

<p>“All right. Now, there isn’t much room in
here, Miss Granger, for us to dress. So if you’ll
go out while Miss Baldwin and I are about it, it
will facilitate matters—don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Well, I like that!” gasped Molly, in a tone
that showed she did not like it at all.</p>

<p>But Beth only laughed. That the strange girl
assumed the right to give orders did not trouble
the even temper of Beth Baldwin. She said:</p>

<p>“Cynthia is right, Molly. It is close quarters
in here. And please run and see if you haven’t a
collar or a collarette that you can spare, and that
will help out on this shirt waist I am going to ask
Cynthia to wear instead of that brown one.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Molly.</p>

<p>“My! you girls are awfully particular about the
way I look,” Cynthia Fogg declared.</p>

<p>“If you want to go to Rivercliff with us,” Beth
said firmly but pleasantly, “you must look neat.
Mustn’t she, Molly?”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed!” exclaimed the girl questioned.</p>

<p>“If I look too nice will they think I need the
job?” Cynthia asked, bluntly.</p>

<p>“Cracky-me!” ejaculated Molly, losing her momentary
“grouch.” “Madam is awfully particular!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
She’d judge your ability to keep her things
neat by the neatness of your own apparel—sure
she would!”</p>

<p>She ran away cheerfully to find things in her
suitcase to help bedeck the runaway.</p>

<p>“If I could only get to my trunk!” Beth said
to Cynthia. “I’ve a hat there that——”</p>

<p>“Why! mine is a perfectly good hat. Don’t
you think it’s rather striking?” asked Cynthia,
with her face turned from Beth’s gaze.</p>

<p>“Goodness, yes! That’s the very trouble,”
gasped Beth, looking at the green hat with the
purple feather.</p>

<p>“And the girl who wore it really worked as a
maid and waitress,” declared Cynthia, as though
that settled the question of its suitability.</p>

<p>But Beth was puzzled. Cynthia spoke just as
though she were playing a part and was proud of
the fact that she had dressed for it. Yet the girl
from Hudsonvale could not put her finger upon
one word Cynthia had said or one thing that she
had done which really bore out the suspicion that
she was not exactly what she pretended to be—a
fugitive from some institution where girls without
home and friends were confined.</p>

<p>There was nothing vulgar or mean in the
strange girl’s speech or actions. She was abrupt
and rather impolite at times. But that abruptness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
seemed to spring from a frank character repressed,
rather than from a lack of appreciation of
proper behavior. Indeed, Beth fancied that Cynthia
felt no social inferiority and was used to treating
others as her equals in that respect. Or was
it that she felt herself naturally superior to most
of those whom she met?</p>

<p>A strange combination was Cynthia Fogg, that
was sure.</p>

<p>Beth finished dressing first and went in search
of Molly Granger. The jolly girl demanded first
of all:</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the strangest girl you ever met, Beth
Baldwin?”</p>

<p>Beth sighed. “I don’t know,” she said. “Either
she does not know when she offends good taste or
she does not care. She is an odd-acting girl for
one in her position.”</p>

<p>“Yet,” said Molly, reflectively, “there is something
taking about her.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say,” said Beth, brightening up.
“Anyway, we’ll see if we can get her taken on
by Madam Hammersly. My! she is so abrupt.
I wonder what the madam will say to her?”</p>

<p>“Will she even give her an interview?” asked
Beth.</p>

<p>“Sure. We’ll get her a chance to see the
madam,” said Molly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“You must do that,” said Beth. “I am a
stranger.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me,” said the other girl, with assurance.
“But that hat! If we could only lose it!”</p>

<p>“I’d gladly give her another,” Beth cried.</p>

<p>“Jolly! leave it to me,” Molly said, again nodding.
“I know what to do.”</p>

<p>They went back together to Number Fifty-three.
Cynthia was completely dressed, and Beth
said to her:</p>

<p>“Come on now. We’ll go to breakfast.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve no money!” exclaimed the freckled
girl.</p>

<p>“I have invited you to go with me,” said Beth.</p>

<p>“With us,” put in Molly Granger. “You will
be our guest to-day. How far up the river is
your fare paid?”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, I had a ticket—er—given
me to Jackson City,” replied the other,
speaking slowly.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Molly, quickly. “That’s beyond
Rivercliff. You can get a stop-over.”</p>

<p>“Well!” said Cynthia Fogg, with a burst of
emotion. “You are good to me!”</p>

<p>“Let’s go out on deck for a breath of fresh air
first,” Molly suggested.</p>

<p>The trio went outside, through one of the sliding
doors. The deck was wet and the mist stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
congealed in drops upon the railing. Into the fog
their gaze could not penetrate a dozen yards. All
they could see was a portion of the steamboat itself,
and the grayish, muddy water lapping alongside
and below them.</p>

<p>“Ugh, how nasty!” said Cynthia Fogg with a
shudder, leaning over the wet rail.</p>

<p>“Oh!” squealed Molly, and fell heavily against
the taller girl. In grabbing at her own hat, her
elbow struck Cynthia’s topheavy “creation,” and
the abomination flew off the freckled girl’s head.</p>

<p>“What <i>are</i> you doing?” demanded Cynthia, in
some heat, although her voice remained low and
well modulated.</p>

<p>“How awkward!” gasped Molly. “Will you
forgive me, Miss Fogg?”</p>

<p>The hat had dropped into the water and now
danced astern. Cynthia cried, rather wildly:</p>

<p>“How shall I ever recover it?”</p>

<p>“Hat overboard!” exclaimed Molly, giggling
now. “Call all hands!”</p>

<p>“Well—it’s my only hat! I don’t believe you
care,” said Cynthia, eyeing Molly doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind!” Molly said. “No use
crying over spilled milk.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t milk,” said the freckled one. “It
was a perfectly good hat.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Molly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“What’s the matter, Miss Granger?” asked the
tall girl, suspiciously. “Don’t you suppose I paid
good money for that hat?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” giggled Molly. “Only if
you did, you must have been color blind.”</p>

<p>At that Cynthia Fogg burst into a low, agreeable
laugh. Her blue eyes brightened and
twinkled. Under her usual demure manner there
certainly was some sense of fun in this strange
girl.</p>

<p>“If I could only get to my trunk,” Beth began,
but Molly cried:</p>

<p>“She’ll look all right bareheaded.”</p>

<p>“They will take me for an immigrant,” said
Cynthia.</p>

<p>“That’s better than looking like a scarecrow,”
said the saucy Molly. “Jolly! if you’d worn that
freak hat up to the school, and the girls had seen
you——”</p>

<p>“But I sha’n’t mix with the young ladies who
attend Rivercliff School,” said Cynthia Fogg, demurely.</p>

<p>“You won’t mind going without a hat for one
day—and on this boat?” said Beth.</p>

<p>“Of course she won’t!” cried Molly.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave mine in the stateroom, too,” suggested
Beth.</p>

<p>“So will I,” the jolly girl declared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>Cynthia laughed again. “I never saw girls like
you two before,” she said. “Go ahead, I’ll do
whatever you say. I’m in your hands.”</p>

<p>Beth secretly thought that Cynthia had made a
very honest confession in this statement. She
seemed perfectly satisfied to allow her friends to
go ahead and plan for her.</p>

<p>They went upstairs to the saloon deck to breakfast,
and had a very pleasant meal, despite the
gloominess of the day. Beth noted that Cynthia
had surely been well brought up. She was quite
used to good form in table manners. She was not
on her guard against mistakes; the proper table
etiquette was as natural to this runaway girl as
breathing.</p>

<p>The <i>Water Wagtail</i> plodded up the river
through the thick mist all the forenoon, stopping
now and then at misty landings. But at noon the
weather cleared suddenly and then the beauty of
the banks was revealed to Beth Baldwin, who had
never before been so far from Hudsonvale.</p>

<p>During the forenoon two girls came aboard the
steamboat whom Molly Granger introduced to
Beth. They were Stella Price and Lil Browne.</p>

<p>“Notice the ‘e,’ please, at the end of Lil’s
name,” said the jolly girl. “That is why she is
a ‘Brownie’—and we all call her that, don’t we,
Brownie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“Of course <i>we</i> do, Jolly Molly,” returned the
new girl, laughing.</p>

<p>So Beth learned that, quite in keeping with her
language and character, her new chum was known
by everybody at Rivercliff as “Jolly Molly”
Granger.</p>

<p>Cynthia Fogg stayed in the stateroom most of
the day. She did not put herself forward or try
to take advantage of the other girls’ consideration
for her. She kept to herself, either from a feeling
that she was not of the class of these girls going
to Rivercliff to school, or because—because——</p>

<p>“Can it be that she feels herself <i>above</i> us?”
thought the puzzled Beth.</p>

<p>But she did not whisper this thought, even to
Molly Granger.</p>

<p>The day was spent pleasantly enough by Beth
and the other girls. The banks of the river were
an ever-changing panorama of beauty; the small
landings and the larger towns came in rapid succession,
for it was a thickly inhabited part of the
State.</p>

<p>Late in the day Rivercliff came into view.
Molly pointed it out to the Hudsonvale girl with
pride.</p>

<p>There was a small landing at the foot of a high,
gray bluff. The village on the river’s immediate
bank did not number fifty houses. A road, plainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
marked, wound up the face of the bluff, to which
several little houses clung like limpets to a rock.
On the brow of the bluff was a huge, brick house,
with towers at the two front corners, and wings
thrown out on either side. There were several
smaller buildings that evidently belonged to the
school, too.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Beth Baldwin, at first view,
thought Rivercliff School rather ugly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>A NEW WORLD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth Baldwin</span> had always supposed that all
girls were “just girls.” Her experience in the public
schools of Hudsonvale had taught her that
most of her companions were, as Ella sometimes
said, “made by the piece and cut off by the yard.”</p>

<p>That is, after all was said and done, there was
not much variety in girls’ characters as displayed
by the girl pupils of the Hudsonvale schools.
There were the nice, quiet girls, and the wild, “giggly”
ones; the vain girls, as well as the meek, inconsequential
girls; with a scattering of smart,
up-to-the-minute girls, as well as some lovable,
cheerful girls whom it was a delight to know; and,
of course, there were a few downright mean girls
who were best left alone.</p>

<p>In fact, Beth, before coming to Rivercliff
School, had thought of girls as “sorts,” rather
than as individuals. She was now to learn that
one of the things that a well conducted boarding
school does to a girl, is to bring out her individuality,
and if she has any color to her character at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
all to deepen that color and develop her distinctive
traits.</p>

<p>Molly Granger was just a little different from
any girl Beth had ever before known. Despite
her jolly, careless, cheerful disposition she was
certainly different, for instance, from Beth’s
friend, Mary Devine. There was a self-confidence
in Molly that no girl could possess without having
been out in the world for some time. Yet she was
not bold.</p>

<p>Stella Price and “Brownie,” as Beth found all
the other girls called Lilian Browne, were likewise
distinctly dissimilar. Both were in the grade
above that which Beth would enter. They called
themselves “sophomores.”</p>

<p>Stella was a strangely aloof girl—one of those
persons whose minds seem traveling afar most of
the time, without being dreamers. Oh no! there
was nothing idealistic in Stella Price’s character.
But, if a member of a group of girls, she was
always the one who appeared to be listening and
who seemed to have little in common with the rest
of the crowd.</p>

<p>“You’d think,” was Molly Granger’s comment
upon Stella, “that she was as wise as an owl. The
appearance of wisdom fairly trickles out of her
lineaments right now, doesn’t it? And I wager
she’s thinking of nothing more important than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
whether she’ll have two or four rows of stitching
on the hem of her skirt.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p092.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">A TALL, MASTERFUL GIRL STOOD AT THE MAIN ENTRANCE<br>
TO WELCOME THEM.<br>

<span class="illoright2">Page <a href="#Page_93">93</a>.</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Molly!” laughed Beth.</p>

<p>“Fact. As for Brownie—she’s just a nice, cuddly
girl, and I love her. But she’s the most obstinate
toad in the whole school!”</p>

<p>This conversation had been held on the boat.
Of course, Beth had little chance to see many of
her schoolmates that first evening. She and
Molly, with the two sophomores and Cynthia
Fogg, piled into an automobile bound for the
school. Molly put Cynthia beside the driver.
Stella and Brownie were very curious about Cynthia.</p>

<p>“Who is she, Molly?” whispered Brownie.
“She’s never coming to the school?”</p>

<p>“Not as a pupil. I’m going to try to get her a
place with Madam Hammersly.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! The poor thing,” sighed Stella,
commiseratingly.</p>

<p>Evidently, the girls considered the principal’s
mother a good deal of a Tartar. Beth herself
had an opportunity for judging almost as soon as
they arrived at Rivercliff, regarding the important
person in question.</p>

<p>A tall, masterful girl stood at the main entrance
to the great school building to welcome the
arrivals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Just report yourselves at the office, Stella and
Brownie and Jolly Molly. Who’s the freshie?”
she asked, halting Beth.</p>

<p>“Beth Baldwin,” she was told.</p>

<p>“All right. You for the madam’s room.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see to her, Miss Teller,” said Molly, very
respectfully, to this senior. “I’m going with Miss
Baldwin to the madam.”</p>

<p>“And who’s this?” demanded the monitor,
stopping the hatless Cynthia.</p>

<p>“I am going to take her to the madam, too,”
whispered Molly. “She’s a girl looking for work
as parlor-maid or waitress or something.”</p>

<p>“We-ell. You know this isn’t the entrance for
them. And madam is dreadfully particular,” said
Miss Teller, doubtfully. “Come back and tell me
if she’s to stay, Molly.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the other, and she with her
two protégées went in.</p>

<p>The entrance hall of Rivercliff School was a
revelation to Beth. She had been in two or three
of the better houses of Hudsonvale besides that of
Mrs. Euphemia Haven; but none of them had
been on a scale with this, nor of such style.</p>

<p>The ceiling was very lofty. There were several
very good paintings on the walls, and they were
properly hung. The furniture was heavy and of
substantial appearance, rather than ornate. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
upholstery and hangings were in soft tones and of
rich fabrics which gave an air of splendor to the
place that almost awed the newcomer. She felt
very much like the country mouse visiting his city
relative.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it scrumptious?” whispered Molly, who
appreciated just how the new girl felt. “I tell you,
this and the two drawing-rooms are the show
places of Rivercliff.”</p>

<p>“And this beautiful staircase,” murmured Beth,
gazing up the polished spiral that ascended in the
middle of the great room.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” giggled Molly, “this reception
hall and that staircase were what brought me here
to school?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” exclaimed the jolly girl, but with more
seriousness. “Aunt Celia came here first and saw
it. Then Aunt Catherine journeyed up the river
to behold its wonders. Next, Auntie Cora and
Aunt Carrie thought they must see it—and they
did so.</p>

<p>“I came to school for the first term, and Aunt
Charlotte got so lonesome for a sight of me, so
she said, that she came up to visit. But I found
her here, every chance she got, just soaking her
mind in the artistic atmosphere of this reception
hall,” giggled Molly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“After that Aunt Cassie and Aunt Cyril simply
<i>had</i> to see it——”</p>

<p>“But, Molly!” almost shrieked Beth, in amazement,
seizing the other girl by her arm. “Every
one of your aunts’ names begins with ‘C’!”</p>

<p>“Yes. I know it.”</p>

<p>“But—but—— Isn’t that funny?”</p>

<p>“No. Only alliterative,” said Molly, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>Cynthia’s low, mellow laugh broke out suddenly.
“And their parents never even thought of
my name, I suppose?” she said.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. At least, grandmother had no
other girls to name. She liked the ‘C,’ I suppose,
because all her forebears were mariners,” declared
Molly, with great seriousness.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear the like?” murmured Cynthia
Fogg.</p>

<p>“I wonder how much we can really believe of
what Molly says?” said Beth, pinching the culprit’s
ear. “All this about your aunts—and seven
of them!—make me doubt if you have any aunts at
all.”</p>

<p>“Cracky-me!” ejaculated Molly. “Wait till
you see ’em.”</p>

<p>“Shall I ever?” said Beth Baldwin.</p>

<p>“I have their pictures—drawn by myself—in my
room,” said Molly, solemnly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Come, Jolly Molly!” warned the tall senior
behind them, “take the freshies along with you to
the madam.”</p>

<p>Molly marched briskly in the lead toward the
rear of the great hall. Beth saw several girls
looking over the balustrade above; but they
popped back in a hurry, laughing, when they saw
themselves observed. There was, however, from
somewhere above, the hum of voices.</p>

<p>It was after the supper hour. There must be,
Beth thought, a recreation room on the second
floor where the pupils gathered in the evening.</p>

<p>Molly was knocking with gloved knuckles on
a door at the rear of the hall. A brisk voice said,
“Come in!” and the girls entered a very plainly
furnished, yet pleasant room. It was a contrast
to the luxurious entrance hall of the school; but
everything was good and very comfortable.</p>

<p>There was revealed, when the door swung open,
a lady in black, with a white lace collar on her old-fashioned,
full-skirted gown and a white cap on
her iron-gray curls. She was sitting in a high-backed
chair at a small desk, on which was an account
book. She stood up promptly, in quite a
military fashion, and looked at the trio of youthful
visitors through her eyeglasses.</p>

<p>She was a small, slight woman, in reality; yet
she stood so straight, and looked so stern and unbending,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
that she seemed to Beth to be at least six
feet tall.</p>

<p>“Good evening, young ladies. Miss Granger,
I am glad to see you back. How did you leave
your aunts?”</p>

<p>“All seven of them, Madam?” asked Jolly
Molly, roguishly. “Collectively, do you mean, or
shall I give their individual symptoms?”</p>

<p>“I see you are determined to wear the cap and
bells,” said Madam Hammersly; yet she smiled.
“I fancy all seven are reasonably well.”</p>

<p>“And all seven sent their respects to you,
Madam,” declared Molly.</p>

<p>“They are very kind. Will you introduce these
others, Miss Granger?”</p>

<p>She glanced swiftly from Beth to Cynthia and
back again as she asked the question.</p>

<p>“This is Miss Beth Baldwin,” Molly said.
“She comes from Hudsonvale. I met her on the
boat. We are chums already, Madam Hammersly.”</p>

<p>The madam nodded and smiled at Beth; but the
latter did not feel that she was expected to take
the lady’s hand, nor was it offered.</p>

<p>“She enters the first-grade, you know, Madam.
Can’t she have the room next to mine?” begged
Molly. “You see, she has no friend here but me,
and has never been away from home before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“I will think of that,” promised the madam.
Then she looked inquiringly at Cynthia Fogg.</p>

<p>“And this, Madam Hammersly,” Molly said,
stepping nearer to the lady, “is a girl we met who
is quite needy. She is looking for work. Her
name is Cynthia Fogg. I am very sure she is a
nice girl. She came up from Hudsonvale and
shared my friend, Beth’s, stateroom. I told her
I would introduce her to your notice, Madam.
She really needs work.”</p>

<p>The madam looked askance at Jolly Molly for
an instant. “This is scarcely the time,” she began,
but Molly interrupted:</p>

<p>“I know, Madam. I hope you will forgive me.
But she had nowhere to go—no friends and no
money. She had a ticket to Jackson City, where
she was going to look for work; but she had nothing
in view there, and no more friends than she
has here. Not so many, for Beth and I are her
friends.”</p>

<p>Cynthia Fogg flashed the jolly girl a single wondering
glance. That anybody should show particular
interest in her seemed to amaze her.</p>

<p>“I—don’t—know,” said Madam Hammersly,
slowly, looking at the applicant thus introduced
with her very sharp eyes. “You may sit down,
girl. I will see you after I have finished with the
young ladies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>She at once made a sharp distinction between
the pupils of the school and the applicant for
work. Cynthia calmly turned to seat herself in
a chair in a retired corner of the room. Madam
Hammersly looked again at Beth, and with more
interest.</p>

<p>“And this is Miss Baldwin?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Beth Baldwin, Madam,” said Molly, naively.
“And she’s awfully nice.”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt it,” said the lady, kindly. “I
hope you will find Rivercliff a pleasant home and
school, Miss Baldwin. You will not see Miss
Hammersly until morning. Then you may go
to her office for examination after prayers, which
immediately follow breakfast. Miss Granger can
tell you all about the rules of the school—not because
she never breaks them, however,” she added,
with grim pleasantry.</p>

<p>“Go to Miss Small for your supper, Miss
Granger. Later I will see if I can do as you wish
about Miss Baldwin’s room. Have your trunks
come?” she suddenly asked Beth.</p>

<p>“My trunk and bag came with me, Madam,”
answered Beth.</p>

<p>“The remainder of your baggage will come
later, I presume?” said madam.</p>

<p>“Why, that trunk is all I have!” Beth blurted
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“Ah? Your parents do not believe in an extensive
wardrobe for a schoolgirl. Perhaps they are
quite right,” the lady said placidly. “I will see,
Miss Granger, if I can assign Miss Baldwin to the
room of which you speak. You mean Number
Eighty, of which Miss Purcell was the last occupant?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>

<p>“I will see. You may now go. I wish you both
good-night. I hope you will find your place in
this—to you—new world, Miss Baldwin, and find
it easily.”</p>

<p>Beth thanked her, and then turned to Cynthia
before she left the room in Molly’s wake. “I do
hope you will be successful in pleasing her,” she
whispered, warmly squeezing the freckled girl’s
hand.</p>

<p>Then she hurried out. She felt that the madam’s
stern eyes were upon her. This was, indeed, a
new world to Beth Baldwin, and she had much besides
book-lessons to learn in it.</p>

<small>“THE GLASS OF FASHION”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two girls had supper in Miss Small’s
room. Miss Small was the under housekeeper,
and a very excellent woman. Beth liked her at
once.</p>

<p>While they were still at the table, a set of
Japanese gongs, somewhere in the corridor, rung
by electricity, sounded. This marked half-past
eight.</p>

<p>“No chance to show you off to the girls to-night,
Beth,” said Jolly Molly. “That’s the signal
for us all to retire to our rooms. Of course,
‘lights out’ is not sounded for an hour yet; but
visiting back and forth in the final hour before
bedtime is frowned upon by the ‘powers that be.’
That is why I hope the madam will give you Number
Eighty. I have Eighty-one. There’s a door
between and we have the sole use of a private
bathroom. It’s scrumptious!”</p>

<p>Just then a lady entered whom Beth had not
seen before—a pleasant-faced lady with youthful
features but very white hair. Miss Carroll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
owned a baby-fair, pink and white complexion.
Her lovely hair, massed high upon her small head,
made her look queenly—something, Beth whispered
to Molly, in the style of Marie Antoinette!</p>

<p>“Is this Miss Baldwin, Molly?” asked the lady.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Carroll,” Jolly Molly said. “She
is my new chum.”</p>

<p>“Yes? She is to occupy Eighty. I hope we
shall have only good reports this half from Eighty
and Eighty-one.”</p>

<p>“My goodness!” whispered Molly to Beth.
“It’s fairly uncanny the way they seem to expect
bad reports from us! Madam hinted at it. I
don’t see how they all came to have such a doubtful
opinion of you, Bethesda Elizabeth!”</p>

<p>“Of me?” gasped the new girl.</p>

<p>“Why—yes—of course. They <i>know</i> me,” said
Molly, demurely.</p>

<p>Beth laughed. She was sure her new chum had
not a spark of real wickedness in her. But Molly
Granger was full of mischief. Beth now asked
about Miss Carroll.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s math and Eng—and an awfully nice
sort, too.”</p>

<p>“‘Math’ and ‘Eng?’” repeated Beth, laughing.
“Is that her religion and politics?”</p>

<p>“No. What she teaches. Mathematics and
English.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“She’s altogether lovely,” Molly said. “That
cannot be said of all the instructors—no, indeed!
Good-night, Miss Small,” she added, in a louder
key to the under housekeeper. “Come along,
Bethesda! We’ll go up and say ‘how-do’ to our
rooms. Have our bags been sent up, Miss Small?”</p>

<p>“Jonas has them on the lift, Miss,” the housekeeper
said.</p>

<p>“We’ll walk,” said Molly to Beth. “I don’t
like that elevator, anyway—just because they call
it a ‘lift.’ That’s too awfully ‘Henglish’ for me,
you know. I am a true-blue American girl—a
regular ‘jingoess.’ I shout for the Stars and
Stripes, and scream with the eagle——”</p>

<p>“Or at a mouse?” suggested Beth, wickedly.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Yes! Who doesn’t?”</p>

<p>“I wonder if Cynthia Fogg was hired by
Madam Hammersly?” Beth said aloud, as they
mounted the main stairway.</p>

<p>“I’d really like to know, too,” agreed Molly.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose that Cynthia was turned
out? Put right out of doors, I mean, if the madam
did not like her looks?”</p>

<p>“Sh!” whispered Molly. “That’s why I sprang
Cynthia on the madam the way I did. She’s really
the most tender-hearted thing you ever saw or
heard of. She only appears stern. And when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
understands that that girl has no home and
friends——”</p>

<p>“You think she will be kind to her?”</p>

<p>“Sure she will! She’s kind to all the girls who
work for her. Only she’s awfully particular.
You ought to see her going around after them
when they sweep and dust. Oh! if they leave a
speck of dust—— M-m-m!”</p>

<p>“I hope she’ll take Cynthia on,” sighed Beth,
as they reached the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>Two corridors branched away, right and left,
from the gallery around the hall.</p>

<p>“I tell you how we’ll find out about Cynthia—maybe,”
said Molly. “We’ll ask Jonas. Come
on! We want our bags, too. He’ll be waiting at
the elevator in the south wing.”</p>

<p>She started along the corridor into the wing
in question, and then mounted ahead of Beth another
flight to the third floor. They met no other
girls, although some of the doors were open and
Beth caught glimpses of pleasant interiors and
groups of gossiping girls.</p>

<p>They finally came, panting, to the elevator
cage, where a shiny-faced negro boy sat on his
stool inside the car, with the bags belonging to the
two girls at his feet.</p>

<p>“I’m yere, Miss Molly,” he said, grinning at
the girl he knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“I see you, Jonas,” she said, collecting her suitcase
and bag. “I’ve had my eyes treated while I
was home and I can see pretty well now, Jonas.”</p>

<p>“He! he!” giggled the black boy.</p>

<p>“Say, Jonas! Tell me something.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” said Jonas promptly, as he saw Molly
fumbling in her purse.</p>

<p>“Who is the new girl the madam has just
hired?”</p>

<p>“Lawsy!” chuckled Jonas. “How’d you
knowed she hired that girl?”</p>

<p>“She was in madam’s room while we were,”
said Molly, composedly.</p>

<p>“You mean that tall, freckled-faced girl, don’t
you?” asked Jonas.</p>

<p>“Yes. What is her name?”</p>

<p>“Cynthie. Dat wot Miss Small called her when
she brought her downstairs,” said Jonas.</p>

<p>The two girls exchanged satisfied glances.
Molly put a small coin in the boy’s palm. “Come
on, Beth,” she said. “Eighty and Eighty-one are
right around this way.”</p>

<p>A side corridor brought them, followed by
Jonas with the bags, to two doors not far from
each other and with the two numbers in question
painted on the lintels. Other doors were open
on the corridor and Molly Granger was hailed
by other girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“Hullo, Jolly Molly!”</p>

<p>“How are the seven pussy cats?” was one mysterious
greeting.</p>

<p>“How’s tricks, Molly?” demanded one girl.
“Full of new ones?”</p>

<p>“Sh! don’t ruin my reputation right at the
start,” begged Molly, of this last girl.</p>

<p>Beth was peering into the open door of
Number Eighty—her room, where Jonas had already
left her bag. Suddenly a voice drawled behind
her:</p>

<p>“Who is that with you, Molly Granger?”</p>

<p>“My new chum,” said Molly, sharply; and
Beth turned to see who had first spoken.</p>

<p>A girl stood at the open door directly across
the hall from Number Eighty. She was a pale
girl in a light blue kimono of heavy, beautiful
silk, with silver dragons worked upon it—a most
beautiful garment, Beth thought. The girl herself
was languid in her manner, had pale eyelashes
and hair as well as bloodless complexion. Indeed,
she looked as though some pigment was lacking
in her system entirely, she was so positively
colorless.</p>

<p>“What’s her name, Molly?” drawled this
apparition.</p>

<p>“This is Miss Beth Baldwin. Miss Maude
Grimshaw, Beth. You live right opposite to each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
other,” whispered Molly, in conclusion, “and, believe
me! you have opposite natures.”</p>

<p>Miss Grimshaw had given Beth a cold little
nod and had gone back into her room.</p>

<p>“What a beautiful kimono that is she wears,”
Beth said calmly.</p>

<p>“Maude is the one of whom I told you,” Molly
sniffed. “Our ‘glass of fashion and mold of
form.’”</p>

<p>“Oh! the dreadfully fashionable girl?”</p>

<p>“Fashion is no name for it!” groaned Molly.
“She sports the finest frocks at Rivercliff. She
turns all our heads. Oh! she’s a charmer.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Beth, “I fancy you don’t like her,
Molly.”</p>

<p>“Cracky-me!” ejaculated Molly, round-eyed.
“How did you come to guess that?”</p>

<p>Beth saw that her friend felt rather keenly on
this subject, so she did not probe deeper. She
had not seen Miss Grimshaw long enough, herself,
to judge the pale girl. But Molly seemed
to be such a universal favorite, and so kind and
merry with everybody else, that Beth wondered
about Maude Grimshaw. As it chanced, Beth was
soon to learn just what her neighbor in the blue
silk kimono was.</p>

<p>At the present time, however, the girl from
Hudsonvale was more interested in the room she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
was to occupy. There were small girls in the
school who roomed together—“a whole raft of
primes in each dormitory,” Molly explained—but
the older pupils of Rivercliff had each a room
of her own and they could live as privately as they
could at home. And when she had seen them,
Beth thought Numbers Eighty and Eighty-one
must be the nicest rooms in the whole school.</p>

<p>“Which they are—about,” Molly said, when
Beth expressed this belief. “I expected to have
to fight for Eighty-one when I came back this fall.
You see, Greba Purcell had your room for four
years. She left in June just before graduation.
Right away Princess Fancyfoot——”</p>

<p>“Who?” gasped Beth.</p>

<p>“That’s what I sometimes call Maude Grimshaw.
She wanted a couple of her ‘Me toos’ to
have Eighty and Eighty-one——”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘Me toos?’”</p>

<p>“Why, girls who agree always with Princess
Fancyfoot. There are ‘sich,’ my dear, though you
mightn’t suppose it,” Molly said, laughing. “‘For
wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles
be gathered together.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, Molly! I wouldn’t speak so,” begged
Beth.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! <i>Grim</i>-shaw, I might say,” chuckled
Molly. “You don’t know her yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>But there was so much to see and so many new
ideas to grasp, that Beth did not that evening give
much thought to the possibility of an unpleasant
neighbor. Her own room was of good size with
two windows. The bathroom between Number
Eighty and Eighty-one was tiled and had a shower.</p>

<p>“You see,” explained Molly, “Greba’s father
had this bath put in at his own expense for her
particular use. Miss Process, who had my room
before I got it, enjoyed Miss Purcell’s friendship,
too. Oh! Greba was an awfully nice girl—and
her father could have bought and sold Princess
Fancyfoot’s father half a dozen times over and
never missed the money. The Purcells are a different
breed of rich folks from the Grimshaws—believe
me!</p>

<p>“And say! we’re two lucky girls to get these
rooms. First grades don’t usually get their pick
of accommodations. No, indeedy!”</p>

<p>It was not until the next day, however, that
Beth realized the truth of this statement of
Molly’s—and learned, too, what a very unpleasant
neighbor she had in Maude Grimshaw.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>FINDING HER PLACE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> each corridor was a set of the Japanese
gongs, and Beth Baldwin lay awake the next
morning and listened to the electrically rung bells
beginning at the top of the great house and in both
wings, and repeated all down the line. They were
mellow bells and pleasant to hear—and Beth did
not mind rising at seven o’clock.</p>

<p>Although lessons did not begin until Monday,
and not more than half the girls had yet arrived,
the discipline of the school began on this Saturday
morning. Breakfast was at eight; prayers
three-quarters of an hour later. After this general
gathering in the general hall, Beth found her
way to the office, and to her first interview with
the principal of Rivercliff.</p>

<p>Miss Hammersly was of small stature like her
mother. But there was scarcely anything else in
the principal’s appearance, Beth thought, that reminded
the new pupil of the stern and military
madam.</p>

<p>Miss Hammersly had curly hair, it is true, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
had her mother. Possibly she might have been
very pretty as a girl; but the duties and trials of
her position had marred her forehead with lines
of care, and had tinged her hair with gray. She
had very bright eyes like the madam’s own; but
they often softened and became dreamy as she
spoke—the eyes of a truly imaginative person.</p>

<p>Imagination was the root of Miss Hammersly’s
success. Had she not possessed it, and in abundance,
she could never have brought this great
school (and that twenty years before) to a standard
of excellence quite remarkable.</p>

<p>Fortunately, she had obtained the patronage of
wealthy people from the start. Without sacrificing
her standard of excellence that put her graduates
considerably above those from other preparatory
schools of the State, Miss Hammersly managed
to satisfy the parents of girls on whom much
more money than was good for them was spent.</p>

<p>Not that all her pupils’ parents were like Maude
Grimshaw’s. Miss Hammersly had to coax
Maude and her kind along the thorny paths of
learning. Yet some of the brightest girls at the
school were daughters of extremely wealthy people.
Wealth was not a barrier which it was impossible
to hurdle!</p>

<p>“I wrote to your principal at the Hudsonvale
high school,” Miss Hammersly said to Beth Baldwin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
“and he gave me an excellent report of you.
He likewise tells me that you are striving to earn
a part of the money to pay for your courses here
at Rivercliff. Is this so, Miss Baldwin?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Hammersly,” Beth said, rather flutteringly.</p>

<p>“I am glad to have such independent girls as
you with us,” the lady said, smiling kindly. “We
have too many of the ‘parasite’ class in this world.
Welcome to the producer! Be something and do
something in the world; that is a good motto.</p>

<p>“There are ways open to bright girls to earn
money, not only in vacation time, but during the
semester. Later, when you have proved your ability,
there may be pupil teaching. Some of our
primary pupils are not forward children and they
need the encouragement of older girls. I shall be
glad to make use of you in this way, Elizabeth
Baldwin, if you prove yourself capable.”</p>

<p>The lady spoke very kindly to Beth all through
this interview, evidently wishing to convince the
new pupil that she was just as welcome to Rivercliff
School as those girls from wealthier homes.
Yet Beth had already gained an impression that
the tone of the school was one of fashion and idle
show.</p>

<p>At prayers, better than at breakfast, Beth had
been able to gain a view of the school—or of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
such of its membership as was present—and she
saw that there was scarcely a girl among them all
as plainly dressed as she.</p>

<p>Even Molly Granger seemed very fancifully
clothed beside Beth. Beth’s traveling dress was
a very good one. As she had confessed to Molly,
that, and the poplin she had worn to Larry Haven’s
party, were her two best gowns. The other
frocks Mrs. Baldwin had made for her daughter
were of good wearing material, but inexpensive.</p>

<p>“My, but you look like a quiet little brown
mouse!” Molly had said that morning, when she
saw Beth dressed to go down to breakfast.</p>

<p>And even that pleasant comment was a criticism,
Beth now realized. This was truly a new world
to her. She had no idea that girls from fourteen
to eighteen could be so fashionable.</p>

<p>There was a rustle of silk petticoats as the girls
took seats beside her in the hall; the laces displayed
were real; the ribbons flaunted were of the
very best quality; and almost every girl she saw
wore more or less jewelry.</p>

<p>Beth tried the effect of Larry’s present at the
collar of her simple gingham when she went back
to Number Eighty after her interview with Miss
Hammersly, and saw immediately that the pin
did not go at all with such a frock. Even Larry
knew more about what girls wore at a school like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Rivercliff than she and her mother had known!
It was a very pretty pin; but to wear it with a
gingham dress was certainly not the thing.</p>

<p>Jolly Molly said nothing to her about her appearance
save that first comment. But Beth began
to be afraid that her commonplace garments
would shame her new chum before the other girls.
Molly did not dress in such expensive gowns as
many of the girls; but her seven aunts certainly
did not restrict their niece to plain clothing. Beth
saw her chum’s two trunks unpacked in wonder.</p>

<p>It did not take Beth long to unpack her trunk.
It was a small affair at best, and she had had hard
work to find enough to fill it properly before leaving
home. She hung her dresses in the closet very
quickly and shut the door. She was actually
ashamed to have Molly or any of the other girls
examine her possessions.</p>

<p>The girls were continually running back and
forth from room to room, chattering and displaying
their new possessions, and having a good time
generally. For, there being no lessons on this
day, there was naturally more freedom allowed
than usual.</p>

<p>Molly, Beth found, had a wealth of ornaments,
photographs, pennants, Indian beadwork, a real
Navajo blanket, cushions galore, and a multitude
of other articles for the adornment of Number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Eighty-one. Many of these possessions she had
left in the school storeroom during the vacation
months, and now brought them forth.</p>

<p>Beth had brought with her photographs of the
home folk, of course. She had also her own
pretty toilet set and various nicknacks that she
fancied particularly. But Number Eighty looked
like a poor place indeed beside Molly’s room.</p>

<p>“Oh, it takes a year or two at school for a girl
to collect sufficient ‘lares and penates’ for her
room to look real homey,” declared Molly, when
Beth mentioned this difference in the appearance
of their rooms.</p>

<p>“It’s really scarcely worth while my spreading
around my poor little possessions,” laughed Beth.
“There are not enough of them to make a show in
this big room.”</p>

<p>“Quite true, Miss Baldwin,” drawled a voice at
the open door of Number Eighty. “And, therefore,
before you unpack any more of your things
I’ve a proposal to make to you.”</p>

<p>“Hullo! here’s Princess Fancyfoot,” muttered
Molly Granger.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Grimshaw,” said Beth,
placidly, to the girl from across the hall.</p>

<p>“I want you to know my friend, Miss Laura
Hedden,” went on Maude, with a most patronizing
air. “Miss Baldwin, Laura.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Laura was a very dark girl—as dark as Maude
was fair. Instead of having Beth’s brilliant brunette
coloring, however, Laura had a muddy complexion.
Her straight hair was black and her
sharp eyes suspicious. She had not a word to say
for herself, but nodded to Beth rather sullenly.</p>

<p>“We’ve come to talk to you, Miss Baldwin,”
said Maude Grimshaw, looking significantly at
Molly.</p>

<p>“Cracky-me!” cried the latter. “Is anything
you have to say ever a secret, Maude?”</p>

<p>“Not if you get hold of it, Molly,” said the
other girl, promptly. “That is why I have inquired
of Miss Baldwin if we may speak with her
alone.”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” ejaculated Molly, and before
Beth could interfere her chum had flounced
into the passage between the two rooms and
banged shut the door.</p>

<p>“Now that you have driven my friend away,”
Beth said, rather sharply, “perhaps you will be
kind enough to tell me what you want, Miss Grimshaw?”</p>

<p>“Shut that door behind you, Laura,” said
Maude, looking at the hall door by which she and
her friend had just entered. “She may come
around to listen if it is open. Oh, Miss Baldwin,
don’t look at me in that way. We know Molly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
Granger rather better than you do, I fancy. I
understand that you only met her on the boat coming
up to school?”</p>

<p>“That is true,” admitted Beth, quietly.</p>

<p>“So Brownie said. Well! we know Molly.
Don’t we, Laura?”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t we!” echoed the dark girl, and immediately
Beth guessed that Laura Hedden must
be one of the “Me toos” of whom Molly had
spoken. She was Maude Grimshaw’s satellite.</p>

<p>“Is—is it Molly you have come to speak
about?” asked Beth. “For if it is, I shall call
her in. I would not discuss any friend in such a
way as this.”</p>

<p>Maude laughed, but her pale eyes flashed. “Oh,
no. It is your own affairs of which I wish to
speak.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your interest, Miss Grimshaw,”
said Beth. “But I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed the rather exasperated
Maude. “You came up the river with another
girl—a girl whom the madam has hired as maid.
Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“She’s a friend of yours, of course?”</p>

<p>“Cynthia? Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Then I presume—by that and other unmistakable
marks—that you are not from very well-to-do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
people, Miss Baldwin?” demanded Maude, complacently.</p>

<p>“My father earns three dollars and seventy-five
cents a day; my mother made my dresses; I expect
to pay for a part of my tuition here by some
work—of what kind I do not yet know.” Beth
said it all defiantly, her black eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“Quite so,” Maude rejoined, as though all this
was pleasing to her. “Very commendable on your
part, I’m sure, too, Miss Baldwin. And I can
show you how you may at once aid yourself—and
nobody be the wiser.”</p>

<p>Beth looked at her curiously, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“I have always wanted one of my friends to
have Number Eighty,” Maude hurried on to say.
“I’d like to get Eighty-one for another, too; but
Molly Granger is a regular dog in a manger. You,
however, have more sense, I should suppose.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Grimshaw,” said Beth, but
in a tone that did not seem entirely grateful.</p>

<p>“Now, you see what we’re after, Miss Baldwin,”
said Maude, coolly. “I want you to exchange
rooms with Laura. Really, she has a very
nice room in the other wing; but she is too far
away. She is quite necessary to my comfort—really,
she is,” continued the girl. “And I am sure
you will find the girls over there quite as pleasant
as those on this corridor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Thank you, Miss Grimshaw. I do not care
to change,” Beth said, quite calmly. “Of course,
you will excuse me?”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t heard my proposal yet,”
Maude hastened to say. “I expect to pay you for
the accommodation. One doesn’t get something
for nothing in this world—I have found that out!”
and she laughed rather scornfully.</p>

<p>“I do not understand you,” said Beth, sharply.</p>

<p>“Why, you will do something or other for
money to help pay your tuition here. I don’t suppose
it much matters what as long as it is not too
hard. We have had girls like you at Rivercliff
before, Miss Baldwin. Miss Hammersly rather
prides herself upon having about so many each
year, I believe,” she added, carelessly.</p>

<p>“Still I do not understand you!” cried Beth
again, her eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“No? Really? I fancied I spoke plainly
enough. I will pay you for the exchange you
make with Laura, Miss Baldwin,” said Maude,
rather sharply.</p>

<p>“I do not care to make the exchange.”</p>

<p>“But I will pay you for it—don’t you understand?”
demanded the other girl, exasperated.</p>

<p>“You cannot pay me for it—for I refuse,” said
Beth. “I like this room. I like my neighbors—all
but you, Miss Grimshaw. I do not care to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
make the exchange. Now, am I plain enough?”</p>

<p>“My goodness me!” giggled Maude, her pale
face suddenly reddening in a very ugly way. “Nobody
would call you pretty I should hope, Miss
Baldwin.”</p>

<p>“Then I am quite understood?” repeated Beth,
ignoring this remark.</p>

<p>“I suppose you think your room is worth more
than we can afford to pay?” sneered Maude.</p>

<p>“You have struck it—exactly,” said Beth, with
flashing eyes. “You think that I have a price,”
she continued. “Perhaps you have been in the
habit of dealing with girls who will sell anything
they possess for money. I have made Molly my
friend. If I exchanged in this way it would look
as though I did not appreciate her friendship——”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” exclaimed Maude. “You don’t know
her as well as we do. Does she, Laura?”</p>

<p>“I should say not,” sniffed the “Me too.”</p>

<p>“I am glad I do not know Molly in the way you
seem to think you know her,” Beth said, so angry
that her voice shook now. “Will you please go?
The room will remain mine as long as Miss Hammersly
allows me to keep it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on!” snapped Maude, finally, grabbing
Laura Hedden by the arm and marching with
her out of Number Eighty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Beth was glad to see her go; but she wanted
a few moments to recover herself. This was an
unexpectedly unpleasant incident, and the girl from
Hudsonvale shed tears over it—and shed them
frankly. As the door had closed she had heard a
muttered “show such girls their place.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>THE SUNNY SIDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Peek-a-boo!</span>”</p>

<p>Beth started from her chair, hastily wiped her
eyes, and turned to see Molly Granger peering
in at the door of the passage between the two
rooms.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear!” cried Beth, with half a sob.
“I thought you had gone.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear me bang the door?” demanded
Molly, standing culpritwise before her chum with
her hands behind her back. “Well! when that
door is banged <i>it doesn’t latch</i>! There was
method in my madness.”</p>

<p>“Goodness!”</p>

<p>“So you thought I had truly gone and wouldn’t
hear all that nasty Princess Fancyfoot had to
say?”</p>

<p>“Why—why—— Did you?”</p>

<p>“Did I what?” asked Molly.</p>

<p>“Hear her?”</p>

<p>“I listened,” proclaimed Molly, unblushingly.
“I glory in the fact. I am an eavesdropper. By<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
so doing I learned good instead of evil about myself.
And I learned something else.”</p>

<p>Beth was silent.</p>

<p>“I learned what a perfectly loyal friend you
are, Beth Baldwin! You are a dear!” and Molly
flung her arms about the other’s neck and kissed
her warmly. Beth returned the caress; she had
never met a girl before whom she found as dear as
this jolly creature.</p>

<p>“What a really hateful thing that Maude Grimshaw
is!” said the new pupil, after a pause.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you?” cried Molly. “And so
sneering! Not that what she says can hurt <i>us</i>.
Maybe she would have given you a tidy sum to
change rooms with Laura Hedden.”</p>

<p>Beth laughed and tossed her head. “I’ll get
money other ways—or go without,” she said.</p>

<p>“Is it really a fact that you need to earn money
if you stay here in school? Are your folks as poor
as you told Maude?” asked Molly, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“I’m all right for a year. But after that—the
deluge!” Beth replied.</p>

<p>“Well! that is too far ahead to worry about.
Lots of things can happen in a year,” agreed the
happy-go-lucky Molly. “Maybe some rich old
uncle will die and leave you money.”</p>

<p>“But there isn’t any rich uncle—nor any uncle
of any kind,” laughed Beth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Well! that’s good, too,” declared the optimistic
Molly. “There won’t be any poor uncle, then,
to come and live on your folks. Always be thankful!”</p>

<p>Jolly Molly’s sunny disposition was just the
tonic Beth needed after her interview with Maude
Grimshaw. In fact, a naturally serious and
thoughtful girl like Beth easily found her counterpart
in Molly Granger.</p>

<p>“We live on the sunny side of the street,”
Molly frequently proclaimed. “So why not smile?
Send dull Grouch flying to the tall timber. ‘Eat,
drink, and be merry, for to-morrow’—there are
lessons!”</p>

<p>Which was not literally true, for this was said
on a Saturday. That day Molly spent in introducing
her new chum to all the nice girls she knew.
As, after all, “nice” was a very elastic word with
Molly Granger, the girls Beth met were of all
sorts.</p>

<p>Yet they had one thing in common. They were
all well dressed. Beth saw plainly that her simple
wardrobe, prepared by her mother with such tender
care and love, was going to set her a little
apart from the other girls, and mark her as from
another world than theirs. Some of the good
friends of Molly, even, looked askance at Beth’s
gingham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>However, Beth determined to say nothing in
her letter, which she retired to her own room to
write, about this condition of affairs. She put
nothing but love and happiness in the epistle to
the family at home, although she had overheard
one girl ask Molly:</p>

<p>“Say! does she wear that ugly calico because she
likes it or on a bet?”</p>

<p>The jolly girl, however, had foreseen the comments
and the amazement of her friends over
Beth’s plain clothes; and wherever she could, she
repeated (and the story lost nothing in her telling)
the interview Beth had had with Maude
Grimshaw.</p>

<p>“That’s the sort of girl Beth Baldwin is,”
Molly said, out of her new chum’s hearing, of
course. “She is true blue, she is! And it isn’t that
she doesn’t need the money. She does. She’s
only got enough to pay for this first year’s schooling,
she tells me; and she is determined to get three
years at Rivercliff in order to teach. I know she’s
the kind of girl who will succeed. Most of us
here at Rivercliff are a lazy pack——”</p>

<p>“Speak for yourself, Jolly Molly!” cried one.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Bertha Pilling. I don’t have
to hire a prime to come in every morning and put
a cold key down the neck of my nightgown to get
me out of bed in time for breakfast,” shot back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Molly, and the other girls giggled delightedly, for
Bertha was a lie-abed.</p>

<p>“At any rate,” Molly continued, “Beth wants
to earn all she can toward her next year’s tuition
in these two semesters.”</p>

<p>“Why! what can a girl like her do?” demanded
a senior. “Fancy trying to earn money at Rivercliff.
She might borrow it.”</p>

<p>“Beth Baldwin isn’t of the borrowing kind,”
said Molly, staunchly. “She’s earned some money
this summer. She told me so.”</p>

<p>“What doing? Picking berries?” cried one
girl. “She comes from the country, doesn’t she?
I have a cousin who lives on a farm, and she
earned six dollars one summer picking berries.
Her father put enough more to it to pay for a
piano and Madge is always telling about her piano
that she earned by picking berries!”</p>

<p>When the laughter over this story had passed,
Molly said:</p>

<p>“Why, Beth Baldwin posed for an artist. She
told me the woman used her in painting a magazine
cover.”</p>

<p>“What magazine?” demanded the senior, suddenly
diving for the magazine shelf of her study
table. “I thought I’d seen that face before.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Molly, whimsically. “Beth wears
her face in front at present.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Smarty! Miss Baldwin has rather a striking
phiz.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t she?” cried the enthusiastic Molly.</p>

<p>“And here she is!” exclaimed another girl, who
had likewise been going over the magazines. “No
mistaking it for anybody else. That’s Miss Baldwin,
sure enough,” and she showed the cover of
the magazine so that all could see.</p>

<p>“How clever!” drawled another girl. “Fancy
posing for a famous artist.”</p>

<p>Molly was delighted that she had interested
these girls—some of the wealthiest in the school—in
her chum. But a very unpleasant experience
was to arise out of the event for Beth. That, however,
was in the future.</p>

<p>Beth had time in this first very busy day at the
school to think of Cynthia Fogg; but it was not
until Sunday morning that she saw the freckled
girl again.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning the rising bells rang an
hour later than on other days. Beth, having entirely
recovered from the weariness caused by her
journey and her broken sleep on the boat, awoke
at her usual time—and they had been early risers
at the little cottage on Bemis Street. Mr. Baldwin
always went to the locomotive works at half-past
six.</p>

<p>The sun was just peering above the eastern hills.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Beth’s windows faced the south and the farther
shore of the river. Mist was rising from the surface
of the stream, and the few boats plying up
and down the current were scarcely outlined in it.</p>

<p>Up on the bluff the air was clear enough, and the
banks of red and yellow branches across the river
were beautiful in appearance. Up-stream Beth
could see tall pillars of smoke rising through the
fog from the factory chimneys at Jackson City—not
as many of them smoking as usual, however,
because of the day.</p>

<p>The air was too sharp for her to stand at the
window for long; she went about her bath and her
dressing so as not to arouse Molly in the next
room. She put on the dress she had traveled in.
She thought she would wear that on Sundays.
Then she ventured out of her room and along the
corridors to the front stairway.</p>

<p>She saw nobody, nor did she hear anybody until
she had descended to the second floor, and there,
as she started down the staircase, she heard a
mighty yawn from the hall below.</p>

<p>Beth peered over the balustrade. There was
somebody stirring below and in a moment she
caught sight of a girl in cap and apron, waving
a feather-duster at the pictures as though she expected,
by so doing, to conjure the dust off of
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>Beth went down quietly, intending to go out by
the front door; but at the bottom of the flight of
stairs she came face to face with the maid, and
saw that it was Cynthia Fogg.</p>

<p>“My aunt!” ejaculated the freckled girl, smiling
as though she really was glad to see Beth.
“Isn’t this the greatest place you were ever in?”</p>

<p>“I think it’s quite wonderful,” admitted Beth.</p>

<p>“So many girls! I never dreamed of so many
before—never!” laughed Cynthia.</p>

<p>Beth wondered what kind of asylum it was from
which Cynthia had run away.</p>

<p>“How do they treat you, Beth Baldwin?” asked
the maid, curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, very nicely—those to whom I have been
introduced,” Beth replied.</p>

<p>“Don’t you find them proud and stuck up at
all?” was the shrewd query that followed.</p>

<p>“Well—there may be some who are addicted to
that sin,” laughed Beth.</p>

<p>“They tell me there are none but rich girls
here,” went on Cynthia Fogg. “Philo Grimshaw’s
daughter is one. Philo Grimshaw, you know, is
the big soap manufacturer. The Grimshaws never
let people forget that they have money, and people
can never forget how the money is obtained,”
and Cynthia’s mellow laugh did not sound as kind
as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Beth thought it not right to discuss the characters
of the girls with one of the maids. Perhaps
Miss Hammersly or the madam would not
like it. So the girl from Hudsonvale said:</p>

<p>“Do you like the madam, Cynthia?”</p>

<p>Cynthia looked up from her dusting, and there
was a queer look on her features. “Hist!” she
said. “Here she comes. Watch her.”</p>

<p>Beth had not heard her coming, but looking upward
she saw the madam at the head of the stairs.
She had not met her since the first evening when
she and Molly, with Cynthia Fogg, had had their
interview with her. Now, while Madam Hammersly
was descending the staircase, Beth had a
better opportunity to scrutinize her.</p>

<p>She certainly was a very prim old lady. She
was dressed in rustling silk, every fold of which
lay just so. Her cap was wonderful in its starchiness;
the lace at her throat and wrists was beautiful.
In one hand she carried a fine cambric handkerchief
which, now and then as she descended the
stairs, she touched to the spindles of the railing
or flirted into the carvings, glancing at it sharply
through her eyeglasses to see if any dust lurked
there.</p>

<p>Cynthia winked drolly at Beth. “If she catches
us leaving anything undone,” whispered the
freckled girl, “good-night!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>Beth stepped aside, waiting to greet the madam
when she reached the hall. The lady greeted her
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Baldwin. You are an
early riser,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes, Madam. I am used to getting up early.
May I go out upon the grounds?” Beth asked.</p>

<p>“Surely. Take a run about the estate. There
is just frost enough in the air to make it invigorating.”</p>

<p>Then, as Beth turned toward the door, she
heard the madam say to Cynthia:</p>

<p>“There is dust on the balustrade. See my handkerchief,
girl? Begin at the top of the flight and
come down carefully. I will have thoroughness
from you girls, or I will have nothing.”</p>

<p>Beth heard Cynthia utter a faint groan. Then
she slipped out of the door into the open air.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>A GREAT DEAL TO LEARN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly Granger</span> possessed at least one talent
besides the ability to extract fun out of most things.
She could draw quite remarkably for a girl who
had had so little instruction; and made many really
clever cartoons in black and white.</p>

<p>Over her dressing-table was a long study in
feline humor; as Beth called it when she first observed
the piece, “a yard of cats.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it cute?” she cried. “You never did it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did. From life,” Molly said, smiling
at the row of kittens tenderly.</p>

<p>“From <i>life</i>? Nonsense! How could you get
cats to pose for you? And they are too, too funnily
human!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t get the cats to pose. But my aunts did.
I flatter myself I have hit off the characteristics of
the dears.”</p>

<p>“Your aunts?” gasped Beth, horrified.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear. All seven of them.”</p>

<p>“There are seven of the cats,” admitted Beth,
weakly. “But you never deliberately caricatured
your aunts like that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“They’re not caricatures. My aunts are regular
tabbies, anyway; they don’t mind. They
begin to look upon my talent for drawing cats as
a ‘gift.’ You see, Bethesda,” said Molly, laughing
again now, “I can draw cats, and I can’t draw
folks. If I ever attempt your portrait, you’ll
have to appear as a cat. Whatever artistic talent
I have, I’ll never be a portrait painter. So I told
the aunts I wanted to draw them in black and
white, and they all sat for me.”</p>

<p>Beth was as much amazed as she was amused.</p>

<p>“The grave looking cat at the end, with spectacles
and a book, is Aunt Celia; the next with the
knitting and goloshes on her feet is Aunt Catherine.
She always either wears overshoes or carries
them. Auntie Cora is the cute little blue kitten
with the fan.</p>

<p>“Aunt Carrie stands there in her wedding finery—she
still has hopes. She is engaged to a sea
captain who comes home for three weeks about
once in three years. Doesn’t she look too sweet
for anything? Aunt Charlotte is the sly, plump
one—you <i>know</i> she’s just lapped up all the cream.
Aunt Charlotte manages to get the best of everything.</p>

<p>“Aunt Cassie is the one in furs and mittens;
she’s always cold. I believe she’d get chilblains
in July. On the end is Aunt Cyril—you can see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
she is an aristocrat, the dear! I’m quite proud
of my aunties—but nobody ever called them a yard
of cats before,” and Molly giggled.</p>

<p>Beth Baldwin’s introduction to Rivercliff School
was not all fun and frolic. On Monday came
lessons—the beginning of the fall and winter
semester. Miss Hammersly and her teachers were
quite firm in their intention of making the students
of Rivercliff work. And few of them—lazy or
otherwise—cared to have a monthly report go
home, across which was printed “defective.”</p>

<p>Miss Hammersly’s idea was that girls came to
her to study—and for no other reason. This was
not a boarding school where the pupils could work
or not, as they pleased. “Ours is not an institution
for the encouragement of girls lacking in gray-matter,”
Miss Hammersly was wont to say. “I
am very sorry for the defectives; but three such
reports send them home.”</p>

<p>Beth found that the working hours of the school
were fully occupied, and that the recreation hours
were not long enough for any of the students to
get very deeply into mischief.</p>

<p>Even jolly Molly had to repress her super-abundant
spirits; or rather, after being under the
ministrations of the instructors of Rivercliff
School all day, by supper time the most spirited
girl in the school was subdued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“Goodness!” confessed Molly to her chum,
coming wearily into Number Eighty and dropping
an armful of books on Beth’s study table, “I feel
like a wornout dishcloth that’s been drawn sixty
times through a knothole! Miss Carroll has just
about finished me this time, Beth Baldwin. If I
don’t get up to-morrow morning, just write my
seven aunties that I died in a good cause—in an
attempt to acquire all the knowledge in the world
within an infinitesimal length of time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Molly! it’s not so bad as all that,” Beth
said, laughing, though rather ruefully, for she
found the system followed at Rivercliff entirely
different from that at the Hudsonvale high
school. Larry had been right. Three years at
this establishment—if she could keep up—would
put her a long lap ahead in education.</p>

<p>Her own end of the table was piled high with
books, for the two chums studied each evening together—and
preferably in Number Eighty.
Eighty-one was too apt to be the Mecca of girls
who desired to scamp their work and barely get
through on the monthly reports “by the skin of
their teeth.”</p>

<p>“Which is a perfectly proper expression, and <i>not</i>
slang, Beth Baldwin, no matter what Miss Carroll
may say,” Molly declared. “Who was it said it—Job
or the psalmist?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“That is your question—you answer it,” replied
Beth. “But what do you make out of this
awful passage Miss Felice has given us to construe?
It’s a heart-breaker, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>They set to work. They were not the only
studious girls on the corridor; but there was a
good deal of noise outside, and Beth closed the
door to shut some of it out. Having retired to
Number Eighty, Molly hoped her old friends
would not annoy her.</p>

<p>“I am determined to delight the aunts this
year,” Molly said. “I’ve told them I have a new
chum and that she is studious. Maybe it’s catching.”</p>

<p>This evening was within the first fortnight of
the term. Naturally, Beth had not made many
friends as yet. The girl who attends strictly to
her lessons in a boarding school is slower in making
friendships than she who is careless of her
standing on the reports. So the gay ones were
not apt to come and pound on the door of Number
Eighty for admittance.</p>

<p>Not that Beth did not take plenty of recreation.
Indeed, that was compulsory to a certain extent.
There was a physical instructor and a splendid
gymnasium—the latter a handsome building, the
gift of a wealthy graduate of Miss Hammersly’s
establishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>There was a splendid athletic field, too, with a
cinder track, courts for basket-ball and tennis; and
at the foot of the bluff, which was reached in the
school wagonette, was a boathouse with a number
of two, four, and eight-oared shells, as well as
canoes and a power launch of some size.</p>

<p>Nothing was neglected that would add to the
physical development, as well as the mental well-being,
of the girls. Miss Hammersly did not
graduate weaklings in any particular.</p>

<p>Save Maude Grimshaw, such girls as had
spoken to Beth had been kind. But except Molly
and a few of her intimate friends, nobody at Rivercliff
had paid very much attention to her. She had
been popular in Hudsonvale, and she missed Mary
Devine and her other schoolmates who had deferred
to her there.</p>

<p>She did not even have an opportunity of talking
with Cynthia Fogg, the strange girl who had come
up to Rivercliff with her on the steamboat. She
saw Cynthia now and then, going about her duties.
She waited at a neighboring table to Beth’s
in the dining-room. But there could be no communication
of any extended character between the
“young lady students” and the maids employed at
the school. Madam Hammersly’s eye was too
sharp.</p>

<p>This night, while Beth and Molly were deeply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
engaged in their books, both suddenly looked up
to see an unexpected figure standing in the doorway
of the passage into Molly’s room. It was that
of a girl in a kimono with a red bag over her
head, masking her completely, for there were only
two little holes in the bag to see through. It was
a startling apparition, and Molly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Cracky-me! How you scared us! Go away—do!”</p>

<p>The girl behind the mask of turkey-red giggled.
Then she stalked forward and placed two folded
red bags, like her own, on the study table.</p>

<p>“Number Sixty-two. Ten-thirty,” she said, in a
sepulchral voice, and immediately marched out
again by the way she had come.</p>

<p>“Well!” gasped Beth.</p>

<p>But Molly began to giggle now. “It’s just
awful—this trying to be a ‘grind.’ My poor, poor
Bethesda! your chum’s former reputation is
against our ever being the twin Minervas of Rivercliff
School.”</p>

<p>“But what does this mean?” demanded Beth,
trying on one of the bags.</p>

<p>“Kimono party—sometimes called red-head
party. You can see what the bags are for. Unless
you are familiar with the kimonos of the whole
school, you can’t be sure of who is at the party—save
the legal occupant of the room in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
party is held. And sometimes the girls exchange
kimonos. So that helps.”</p>

<p>“Helps! How?”</p>

<p>“Why, if we are caught, and can run, the
teacher or monitor who catches us can’t see who
we are with the bags over our heads. And those
who are captured can’t tell on the rest, for everybody’s
masked and we can’t be sure. See?”</p>

<p>“Are you going to-night?” Beth asked.</p>

<p>“What number did she say?” rejoined Molly.</p>

<p>“Sixty-two.”</p>

<p>“Let’s! That’s Mamie Dunn’s,” cried Beth.</p>

<p>“Aren’t there two Sixty-twos?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the kimono parties have to be wing affairs.
Guests can’t slip over from one wing to the other.
They have to be localized.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the curious Beth.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s always somebody on watch at
the top of the main flight of stairs—and there’s
no other way to go from wing to wing than by that
cross-corridor.”</p>

<p>“On watch all night, do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Sure. For fire protection; likewise if anybody
should be taken sick in the night.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Beth, reflectively, “that these
after-hours parties are against the rules of the
school?”</p>

<p>“I suppose they are,” admitted Molly, with serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
mouth but twinkling eyes; “but I never really
asked.”</p>

<p>Beth laughed. “Did you ever get caught at one
of these parties?”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that! We’ll go to-night.
All work and no play makes Jill just as dull as her
brother.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do our tasks first, dear,” said Beth.</p>

<p>She was not a prude; but she felt herself in
honor bound to keep up with all her lessons. She
had been at Rivercliff long enough to know that
she could not earn her diploma in any easy way.
To fall back one recitation would mean hard effort
to make it up. There were no delays for the slow
and inattentive under Miss Hammersly.</p>

<p>Beth, of course, had written home several times.
She had told the home folk of all the interesting
things she had encountered thus far in her school
life, and about her teachers and the students as
she had met them with the one exception of Maude
Grimshaw. She had not mentioned that haughty
and purse-proud girl. Beth hoped she would never
be obliged to come in contact with Maude again.
She thought that, by letting her unpleasant neighbor
strictly alone, Maude would let her alone.</p>

<p>She was yet to learn the fallacy of this belief—as
well as much else that Beth could never have
learned anywhere but at Rivercliff School.</p>

<small>THE RED MASQUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two chums working in Number Eighty,
South Wing, Rivercliff School, closed their books
before the retiring bell rang at nine-thirty, fully
satisfied with what they had accomplished.</p>

<p>“No use climbing into bed, Bethesda,” said
Molly, with a yawn. “Just get into something
comfortable—of course, your kimono—and we’ll
put out the lights at the proper time.”</p>

<p>“Why—will anybody look in?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. You never can tell. It is according
to who is on watch to-night. We never know
whose duty it is. Miss Crouch is perfectly sneaking——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Molly!”</p>

<p>“Yes, she is. She wears sneaks when she is on
guard, and she often opens our doors and looks
in. And if you lock your door she is likely to rap
on it and wake you up. Says she wants to be sure
you are all right.”</p>

<p>“Are we supposed to leave our doors unlocked?”
Beth asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“Why, you can do as you please. But if Miss
Crouch feels like looking into your room in the
middle of the night, she’ll get you up to open the
door. She’s a suspicious creature.”</p>

<p>“For no reason, I suppose?” laughed Beth.</p>

<p>“Never mind!” Then Molly’s voice dropped
to a whisper: “I’ll show you how to fool Miss
Crouch.”</p>

<p>“What about?” asked Beth.</p>

<p>“If she should feel it necessary to look in while
we are gone—see here!”</p>

<p>Molly rolled the extra blanket which lay upon
the foot of Beth’s bed into the semblance of a
human figure and put it under the bedclothes.
There it looked like a person asleep, wrapped head
and heels in the coverings. Then she made the
same masquerade in her own bed.</p>

<p>They sat in the dark and told each other “giggly”
stories in whispers until it was about half-past
ten and the whole school seemed buried in
sleep. But there is scarcely anything more uncertain
than a boarding school between retiring hour
and the first bell in the morning. That is an
axiom known to all instructors of experience.</p>

<p>When the two chums ventured out with the red
bags pulled down to their shoulders, there were
other “red-heads” flitting about the corridors.
They slipped in and out of the various doors like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
red-topped ghosts. It was evidently to be a
large party in Mamie Dunn’s room.</p>

<p>“Sh! Who’s on watch?” one unknown asked
Beth.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m sure I don’t know,” returned the new
girl, and at once the girl asking the question
laughed, and said:</p>

<p>“So you’re the new one, aren’t you? I thought
I’d know your voice. And now I’ll know your
kimono.”</p>

<p>“That’s Stella—didn’t you hear?” said Molly.
“She caught you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! aren’t you supposed to know each other?”
asked Beth.</p>

<p>“Just as well if we’re not identified. I’ve got
on a new kimono. I’m just going to keep it for
these red-head parties. You get one, and then
we’ll fool ’em.”</p>

<p>The question was repeated several times before
the chums reached Sixty-two:</p>

<p>“Who’s on watch?”</p>

<p>“I wager it’s Miss Crouch,” jolly Molly said,
but nobody would have recognized her voice.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Phoebe Mills?”</p>

<p>“No. It’s Phoebe’s sister,” said Molly, solemnly.
“Don’t try to catch me, honey!”</p>

<p>“Well, if Miss Crouch is on watch or not, I
dare you to look,” giggled the inquisitive girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“Not me,” declared Molly, shaking her head
vigorously. “Get that crazy Molly Granger to
run and look.”</p>

<p>“I’m looking for her,” admitted the other girl,
going away from the chums.</p>

<p>Molly giggled. “What a chance! That was
Izola Pratt, I believe. She’s a ‘Me too.’”</p>

<p>“You mean one of Maude’s friends?”</p>

<p>“Just so,” said Molly, nodding. “I wonder why
they are all trying to identify us? Maybe Princess
Fancyfoot has some scheme up her sleeve.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that she would report us to
the teachers?” asked Beth, in some alarm.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see her! That would just about
settle Maude Grimshaw in this school. If her
father had as much money as King Midas, and
Maude lived to be as old as Methuselah, she could
never live down such a thing. No indeed! There!
here’s Sixty-two.”</p>

<p>Beth knew Mamie Dunn, but she did not know
who welcomed her into the room. Everybody in
the apartment wore a red mask, and at first the
new girl was not able to recognize any one.</p>

<p>It was a chafing-dish party. A tall girl in a
striking red and black kimono (somehow Beth
thought she must be the senior, Miss Teller)—the
kimono itself well fitted to clothe one who did
deeds of magic—presided over a cheese dish warranted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
as Molly said, to give everybody “dreams
of the rabbit fiend.”</p>

<p>There was bottled ginger ale and tea and coffee.
Such a combination to go into one’s stomach at
such a late hour would ruin the digestion of anybody
but a boarding-school girl.</p>

<p>Beth, even at this party, could not but compare
her own state with that of the other twenty-five
or thirty girls present. There were all sorts and
conditions of kimonos; but all were of very much
richer material than her own pretty, but cheap,
cotton crêpe.</p>

<p>She was really sure of the identity of nobody
save Molly at first. But she began to enjoy herself,
for she was not left alone. She tried to disguise
her voice in answering questions, and so puzzle
the others.</p>

<p>The laughter was subdued, although the walls
were thick and the doors sound-proof. One girl
frequently ventured into the corridor to peer
about. There was a delicious feeling of uncertainty
and peril that spiced this “red-head” party.</p>

<p>The guessing of each other’s identity was a popular
pastime, and when they held a mock court,
with the tall girl in the red and black kimono as
judge, and appointed two guards to bring culprits
before the bar for identification, the fun
waxed boisterous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>Sometimes the girls guessed who the prisoner
was very quickly; at other times they shot broad
of the mark, as was attested by the gaiety of the
one under examination.</p>

<p>But when Beth was seized and forced before
the girl in the red and black kimono, there fell a
little hush of expectation. It seemed to the new
girl as though many of these present had been
waiting for just this event.</p>

<p>“Here is a stranger in our midst,” said the red
and black kimono, in a sepulchral voice. “Who
can she be?”</p>

<p>“It’s plain to be seen she’s a person of note,”
said one, demurely.</p>

<p>“And a person of quality,” added a sharp voice.
“Note the gown she has on. It must have cost
‘trippence’ a yard, as Miss Small would say,” and
there was a rising giggle from a group of masks
in one corner.</p>

<p>Beth flashed a glance that way. She felt the
enmity of these masked girls in the very air. Had
she known how to escape she would have done so
before the mock examination went any further.</p>

<p>In that particular group of girls Beth suddenly
recognized Maude Grimshaw’s blue and silver
kimono. And it was from the wearer of this beautiful
garment that the next unkind observation
fell:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“We are advertised by this young person. Oh!
she is an acquisition to Rivercliff, undoubtedly.”</p>

<p>“You’re not!” snapped Molly Granger’s voice
from behind Beth.</p>

<p>But Maude had her speech ready, and was not
to be sidetracked.</p>

<p>“I suppose this girl began by being photographed
as a patent-food baby. Then she advertised
a brand of soap as she grew older, until now
she has arrived at the dignity of being flaunted in
seven colors on the cover of a cheap magazine.”</p>

<p>There was a murmur of objection from some of
the hooded girls; but there was laughter, too.</p>

<p>“She will doubtless become famous,” went on
Maude, scornfully, “and make Rivercliff famous,
by winding up as the exponent of a toothwash, or
illustrating the use of a pair of shoulder braces.”</p>

<p>The whole company was now in ungovernable
laughter. Beth knew that she should have laughed
herself had the victim been some other girl. Indeed,
she could have laughed with them at the
fun poked at her, had it not been so venomously
done.</p>

<p>“Beth Baldwin!” somebody shouted. “Discovered!
She must pay a forfeit.”</p>

<p>Beth heard Molly sputtering angrily behind her;
but she realized that if she took offence, or if
Molly was allowed to do so, it would only make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
her the more ridiculous. One decision Beth made,
however, right then and there. It was a decision
bound to change the tenor of her whole career at
Rivercliff School.</p>

<p>“Unmask! You’re caught,” ordered the
“judge.”</p>

<p>Beth did so and managed to show a smiling, if
flushed, countenance to the assembly.</p>

<p>“Well, I think it’s mighty clever of her,”
drawled one girl, “if she can earn money posing
for her picture.”</p>

<p>The others were, however, clamoring for Beth
to pay a forfeit. The judge was supposed to accept
suggestions for that. Maude’s sharp voice
was ready:</p>

<p>“Oh, it doesn’t really matter what she does, I
fancy. As long as there’s anything to be earned
by it, Miss Baldwin is prepared to do it. Like our
politicians, she is ‘out for the dough.’”</p>

<p>“How very vulgar, Maude!” said the “judge,”
tartly. “Suppose Miss Carroll should hear that?”</p>

<p>“It’s the truth!” snapped the angry girl. “We,
who are well-to-do, are exploited for the benefit of
these—these paupers that Miss Hammersly allows
to come here to Rivercliff. At least, she
should have the decency to put them in a department
by themselves, and have their sleeping quarters
with the servants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“Shame! Shame!” cried a dozen voices.</p>

<p>“You go too far, Maude,” declared the
“judge.”</p>

<p>“That’s what is the matter with Maude Grimshaw,”
ejaculated Molly, boiling over in her
wrath, finally. “She wanted Miss Baldwin’s room
for one of her ‘Me toos’—and Miss Baldwin
wouldn’t make <i>that</i> exchange for money. Nasty
thing!”</p>

<p>“Girls! stop this!” ordered the girl in red and
black, rising from her seat.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mamie Dunn herself took a hand in
the discussion. She stood up and plucked off her
red bag. She was a plain, rather unattractive girl
who seldom asserted herself; but now she was
quite indignant.</p>

<p>“Stop, Maude Grimshaw. You are the meanest
girl in Rivercliff School—I don’t care if you are
the richest. This is my room and I declare I’ll
never invite you into it again.”</p>

<p>She turned swiftly to Beth and put a protecting
arm about her. “You are a girl I am proud to
have for a friend, Miss Baldwin—I don’t care
what others may say. I know I wouldn’t have the
pluck to try to work my way through school, providing
I could get an education in no other way.
I—I hope you’ll forgive me for inviting you here
to-night where you have been so insulted and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
abused by my other guests. I assure you, it was
not with my connivance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am confident of that, Miss Dunn,” faltered
Beth, for Mamie’s kindness touched her
more deeply than Maude Grimshaw’s unkind
speech. “I thank you, Miss Dunn. I—I can’t
stay. I see very clearly now that I should not
have come in the first place.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that!” cried somebody whom Beth
thought was Brownie, and who was sobbing,
frankly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Beth said, more calmly now, “I see that
I was wrong in accepting the invitation. I am different
from you other girls. I want to get an education,
and I must get it in my own way. My
way is not yours. I hope that hereafter I shall not
be led into accepting invitations that lead to friction
and make everybody concerned unhappy.”</p>

<p>“You’re all right, Baldwin!” said the girl behind
the judge’s mask, huskily.</p>

<p>“I am going to ask you, Miss Dunn, to excuse
me,” Beth proceeded. “I quite appreciate your
kindness, and all you meant to do for me in inviting
me to your party. But—you see yourself—it
is not wise.”</p>

<p>She stammered this—halted at last in her
speech, chokingly—and then made swiftly for the
door.</p>

<small>NO MARTYR’S CROWN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth</span> bolted both the doors, once having entered
Number Eighty, and refused to open
either, though she knew that it must be Molly
Granger who came and softly tapped upon the
panel.</p>

<p>It was some time after Beth had got into bed
that Molly tried to get in. The party in Mamie
Dunn’s room could not have immediately broken
up on Beth’s departure.</p>

<p>The latter lay quietly in her bed and thought
matters out, coolly. She did not weep. She realized
that she had done a foolish thing in trying
to become the comrade of these girls who had so
much more of this world’s goods than she could
ever hope to possess.</p>

<p>“I am different from them all—different, even,
from Molly,” she told herself. “I can keep dear
Molly’s friendship—I prize it too highly to lose it
for any cause; but I cannot be even her social
equal.</p>

<p>“I have come here with the avowed intention
of earning part of my expenses. That immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
puts me on a different plane from the girls
who never have to think of money—only how to
spend it! Maude Grimshaw, hateful as she is,
is more than half right. My place is with Cynthia
Fogg.</p>

<p>“I have a year before me in which to get established
here in my proper place. I can be helpful
to many of these girls. I <i>must</i> be helpful. And I
must be helpful for money. There are things I
can do, and that they need done, and for which
they will willingly pay me. I am not ashamed of
any decent means to earn money—why should I
be?</p>

<p>“Such time as I have aside from the study and
recitation hours and such physical exercises as I
need, must be devoted to earning money. Why!
there are thousands and thousands of girls situated
just as I am, who are making their way through
school and college. Just because I happen to be
in a school for wealthy girls, should make no difference.
What will be the odds, whether they like
me or not, a hundred years from now?</p>

<p>“Nor will I sport the willow,” declared Beth,
“nor wear the martyr’s crown!</p>

<p>“That Maude Grimshaw is half right on another
point, too. I must do anything—anything
that is decent—for money. I can’t be too particular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“I won’t dawdle around here like an abused
chicken, looking for sympathy. I don’t need sympathy.
What did I come to Rivercliff School for,
anyway?</p>

<p>“Why! I came to <i>work</i>—in two ways. I’ve
taken hold of my lessons all right, I flatter myself,”
went on Beth, answering her own question,
“and now I must think of taking up my other
branches. I am to take a special course of training—learning
to make money. I’ll begin to-morrow.”</p>

<p>And with this resolve she finally went to sleep,
and slept soundly. Beth Baldwin was blessed with
a strain of <i>practical, common sense</i>.</p>

<p>She could be hurt as easily as most naturally
refined girls. She was by no means thick-skinned.
Only, she could grit her teeth and go at a thing
that had to be done, and without weeping over it.</p>

<p>In the morning, almost before Beth had her
bath and was dressed, Molly burst in—but in no
jolly mood, as was plain.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear! Oh, my dear!” she wailed, seizing
Beth about the neck. “I haven’t slept half the
night for thinking of you. That nasty, mean, horrid
Maude Grimshaw——”</p>

<p>“<i>And</i> a cup of tea!” interposed Beth, laughing.
“No more of <i>that</i>, Molly—if you love me. In the
language of my younger brothers, ‘forget it!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“But it isn’t to be forgotten. And I told them
all after you came away last night——”</p>

<p>“Now, Molly dear, if you tell so much you’ll be
completely empty and will collapse—sure,” declared
Beth, laughing.</p>

<p>“But, Beth!”</p>

<p>“But, Molly!” mocked Beth.</p>

<p>“Don’t you care, Beth Baldwin?” cried Molly.</p>

<p>“If I do, I don’t want to wear the martyr’s
crown,” and Beth smiled. “Come, my dear!
‘What can’t be cured must be endured.’ And it
had better be endured cheerfully—don’t you
think?”</p>

<p>“But it can be cured, I tell you!” cried Molly,
very much excited. “Do you suppose the really
nice girls of Rivercliff are going to allow a little
clique of stuck-up things to insult and abuse a girl
who has positively done no wrong? We think too
much of our school itself to allow such a blot to
stand——”</p>

<p>“That sounds very fine, dear,” said Beth,
calmly, “although your metaphor is hazy. And it
is awfully nice of you and your friends to stand
up for me. But there is something to be said on
the other side, I guess.”</p>

<p>“On whose side—yours?”</p>

<p>“No. I fancy I have very little standing in the
premises, when it comes to the facts,” and Beth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
laughed again, though rather bitterly. “I mean on
the side of Maude Grimshaw and her crowd.”</p>

<p>“Oh, them!” sniffed Molly, disgustedly, as well
as ungrammatically. “What about Princess
Fancyfoot?”</p>

<p>“She can claim to hold the welfare of Rivercliff
quite as high as you and your friends do,” Beth
said argumentatively. “She believes that the
school is for a certain class of girls—and for no
other. And, really, the girls themselves bear out
her claim, don’t they? Am I not about the only
poor girl here?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure!” exclaimed Molly, “I’m not
rich.”</p>

<p>“What! with seven aunts to support you?”
laughed Beth, bound to keep a cheerful tone in all
the argument.</p>

<p>“But that has nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p>“Yes it has. If I were Maude Grimshaw I
should probably feel just as she does. I am an interloper.
But I am here,” added Beth, with vigor,
“and I mean to stay and get what I came to Rivercliff
for.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Molly. “Then you will fight
’em?”</p>

<p>“Fight? Certainly not. I have no reason to.
I tell you, dear, that I was in the wrong—besides
being <i>in</i> wrong! I should not have gone to Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
Dunn’s party. I tell you I am not one of you, and
cannot be one of you, save in my standing in
classes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Beth! What do you mean?” wailed
Molly.</p>

<p>“I am going to keep to myself—‘flock together,’
as it were,” and again Beth laughed, and this time
quite cheerfully. “No, no, Molly! It’s of no use
to try to get me into your class in society. I
should merely be a ‘hanger-on’—and I should positively
hate myself for such sycophancy.</p>

<p>“Let me be myself. I am poor; no getting
around it. Girls from whom I hope to earn money
won’t treat me as their equal. At least, not these
girls at Rivercliff, for the true feeling of ‘equality
in knowledge’ has never become a tenet of this institution,
as it has in so many colleges.”</p>

<p>“Goodness!” cried Molly. “You mean we are
a school of snobs?”</p>

<p>“Very near it! very near it!” returned Beth,
allowing herself some small display of malice for
the moment. “But, yet, you are not to be
blamed.”</p>

<p>“I am sure, Beth Baldwin, you cannot accuse
me——” began Molly, when Beth swooped down
upon her, seized her in her arms, and cried:</p>

<p>“Don’t be hurt, dear! You are the lovingest
girl that ever lived. But you are not ‘the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
push,’ as Marcus would say. You mean well,
and you could influence some of the other girls, I
know; but I would merely cause a schism in the
school if I went your way.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“A few of your nice girls would always be taking
up cudgels for me. That would cause friction
and do me more harm than good. I must quietly
withdraw from too much publicity. Let me go my
own placid way. I positively will not accept any
invitations to private parties of any kind,” and
Beth laughed. “Never again!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Beth! That’s just what we intended to
do. Every girl that likes you agreed to invite you,
one after another, to little parties, and so show
those stuck-up things that you were more and more
popular.”</p>

<p>“I thought so!” exclaimed Beth, and she smiled
through her tears now. “It is very lovely of
you—and of your friends. But I am going to excuse
myself from all such affairs. Yes, I mean it.
This is my room. Those girls who like me can
always find me here at a proper time. But I shall
make it a rule to attend no other private social
‘orgies.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, Beth!” wailed Molly, again. “You are
shutting yourself off from everything!”</p>

<p>“Oh no, dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“Oh yes, you will!”</p>

<p>“No. I shall not be shutting myself off from
the most necessary thing in my life here at Rivercliff
School,” Beth declared firmly.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake! what is that?”</p>

<p>“Work. If I am not socially connected with
any clique of girls I shall stand a better chance of
getting work from all.”</p>

<p>“Cracky-me! What work?” gasped Molly.</p>

<p>“You didn’t think I was in earnest!” cried Beth.</p>

<p>“But—but—you have a whole year to think of
work.”</p>

<p>“No. I have a whole year—or, almost—to
earn what I need for next year. I must take opportunity
by the forelock, for he will certainly be
shaved close for me behind. A regular ‘Riley cut,’
to quote my slangy brother again. I must not
let the first opportunity get by me.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this expected and much longed-for
opportunity, did not at once appear, as Beth
hoped. She proved to her own satisfaction, however—and
in time to Molly’s—that her attitude
toward the other girls was the wiser one.</p>

<p>She refused every invitation that came to her,
explaining quietly why in each case. If the girls
wanted her, they were welcome in her room during
the short time in the day when visiting back
and forth was permissible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>Many learned to like her—some to admire her—in
that first month of school. Some offered help
that Beth could not accept; but they meant it
kindly. Some few had suggestions that led to the
new girl earning small sums; but nothing regularly.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was her own bright mind and thought
that opened the first really broad path to a certain
independence. She seized this opportunity by its
forelock at the first monthly social evening of the
whole school, arranged by Miss Hammersly.</p>

<p>All through the school year these monthly socials
in the huge drawing-rooms were the principal
events of the kind. There was music and dancing
and a collation. Sometimes there were visitors.
The girls looked forward to the parties with delight.</p>

<p>And as she sat in her pretty poplin in the great
reception hall, quite popular enough, she thought,
Beth had an idea. This season skirts were worn
very short, but the high boots had not come in.
As she glanced up the stairway she had a continual
panorama of silk-clad ankles, as the girls tripped
up and down.</p>

<p>She already had heard some of the girls complain
of the hard wear their silk stockings received.
Every girl in the school (including
herself) wore some quality of silk hose. The pair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
she had on were darned; but so neatly that it
would have taken very close inspection to discover
the mended place.</p>

<p>That was one thing Mrs. Baldwin had taught
Beth—how to darn neatly. She sat now, with the
music and confusion about her, and an endless procession
of silk stockings paraded before her mental
vision.</p>

<p>The very next day she sent off for silks of all
shades, needles, stocking feet of good quality, and
other necessities, and in a week she put Molly’s
artistic ability to the test. Molly demurred at
first; then she entered into the idea hopefully. She
did her very best in lettering the card Beth tacked
up outside of Number Eighty:</p>

<p class="center">SILK STOCKING HOSPITAL<br>
<br>
<i>Major &amp; Minor Operations Performed</i></p>

<p>“Well, there’s some fun in <i>that</i>,” admitted the
jolly one. “At least, the sign will make ’em
laugh.”</p>

<p>But Beth looked for more serious returns than
mere amusement.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>FLINT AND STEEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> letters had passed frequently between
Beth and the little cottage on Bemis Street,
Hudsonvale. Ella was Beth’s most frequent correspondent.
The flyaway sister was eager to learn
every particular about Beth’s new environment.</p>

<p>But Beth was very careful to say nothing in her
letters to those at home to lead them to suspect
that all was not fair sailing for her at Rivercliff.
Having resolved to bear bravely such trials as she
had, Beth was not the girl to weaken.</p>

<p>She was glad to get the home letters, and those
from Mary Devine and the other girls; but the
letter that secretly pleased her most came from
Larry Haven.</p>

<p>To her surprise she had learned that Larry,
immediately after she had departed for school,
had taken up his old habit of dropping in frequently
at the Baldwin cottage.</p>

<p>Ella’s letters were full of “Larry says this” and
“Larry did that” when he was at the house last.
Beth knew he had obtained clients almost at once.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
He even would try a case—his maiden case—at
the October Court.</p>

<p>So his letter, when it came, did not surprise
Beth; and it was evidently written in the first exuberance
of his victory.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“‘<i>Hail to the chief who in triumph advances——</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Who falls off his saddle whene’er his steed prances!</i>’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>the letter began. “‘<i>In hoc signo vinces</i>,’ likewise
‘<i>E pluribus Unum</i>’ and all hands around! I have
arrived. Believe me, Mrs. Euphemia Haven’s
son is being congratulated on the street by the
Elders.</p>

<p>“A certain man in our town, Who was not wondrous
wise, Jumped into a legal bramble bush,
And scratched out both his eyes. I made him see
his eyes were out, So, with all his might and main,
He jumped into another bush, And scratched them
in again!</p>

<p>“That, my dear Beth Baldwin, is the sole and
only meaning of ‘going to law.’ A man goes mad
and runs, frothing at the mouth, to another chap,
to whom the law schools and local bar have given
the right to separate him from his money without
giving laughing-gas. Old Coldfoot, next door to
me, is lots nicer to his victims than I am.</p>

<p>“Well, the chap with the sheepskin shows the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
mad man a perfectly obvious thing to do—and
charges him for the advice; and he collects a second
fee when thirteen other men tell the mad man
the obvious thing is correct.</p>

<p>“This is what I have done, Beth Baldwin. Congratulate
me! All hands think it is wonderful. So
it must be. And I feel that I should have been
broken-hearted if the other side had beaten us.</p>

<p>“Oh! I <i>was</i> scared before the issue. I thought
I must go to extremes to convince the jury that the
other side hadn’t a leg to stand on. I prepared a
very touching appeal in which I should have begged
the jury for mercy and the Court for clemency
for my client, as though he were convicted
of a capital crime.</p>

<p>“In the end—oh! let me confess it—our opponent’s
witnesses made out our case for us. I put
in no testimony but our answer, got up and said
ten words, the jury did not leave its seats, and
the good old judge congratulated me upon having
more sense than most fledgling lawyers because I
did not insist upon making a speech.</p>

<p>“Honestly, Beth, I was greatly relieved when
it was all over. They say I have won my spurs;
but <i>I</i> don’t think the rowels are very sharp yet.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There was more to the jolly letter and Beth
read it over and over again. She was delighted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
hear from Larry; she was delighted, too, to know
that he had succeeded in winning his first case.
Still she wondered. Why had Larry been silent
and kept away from the house during the summer,
and now had become such a steady visitor at the
Bemis Street cottage?</p>

<p>She knew she had her parents’ sanction to write
to Larry, and she did so in reply to his letter. She
told him much about the school and Molly, and
something about the other girls. She wrote of
what she studied and how she took hold of athletics.
But one thing she did not mention. She
said nothing about the “Silk Stocking Hospital.”
She was not ashamed of working to earn money
for her schooling; yet, somehow, she shrank from
discussing that point with Larry.</p>

<p>The hospital, so-called, had become an established
institution long before the holidays. Beth
sometimes found it difficult to keep up with the
principal activities of her school life—her lessons,
the compulsory athletic work, and her stocking
darning.</p>

<p>Miss Hammersly was sharper with her, Beth
thought, than with the other girls, for the very
reason that Beth was striving to do extra work.</p>

<p>“I want to see you succeed, Miss Baldwin,”
the principal said to her on one occasion; “but
in earning money for your tuition, you must not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
lose any of the advantages which the money is
supposed to pay for. I approve of your attempt
at independence only in so far as you neglect no
lessons or other activities that a normal schoolgirl
is supposed to obtain in an establishment of
this kind. You must retain your interest in every
item of school life and work, or your course here
will fail of its end.”</p>

<p>Beth took this advice to heart. She neglected
nothing which she believed was for her mental or
physical benefit. With Molly she won a place on
the Second Five at basket-ball; and before Christmas
week she had proved herself the superior of
most of the girls on the ice.</p>

<p>The river was frozen from the docks to the
bend soon after Thanksgiving, and now Beth and
Molly Granger usually ran down the bluff and
spent the hours between daylight and dark, and
before supper, on their skates. Molly admitted
the exercise woke her up after the long day in
classes and gave her spirit for the study hour before
bedtime.</p>

<p>Beth was not allowed to sit up later than the
other girls, so she usually disappeared right after
supper and sat in Number Eighty, working, with
her darning-basket beside her, until the half-past
eight bell. Then she joined Molly in studying for
the next day’s recitations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>She lost that general social hour between supper
and the first bell; so it was true her personal acquaintanceship
among her fellow-students did not
rapidly expand. Yet many came to her for help
in the “hosiery department.”</p>

<p>“That Baldwin girl in the South Wing darns so
nicely,” one girl said to another. “Why throw
these perfectly good stockings away?”</p>

<p>“What is it some philosopher said?” Beth asked
her chum, laughingly. “If a man does some one
thing better than anybody else, the world will
beat a path to his door?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” grunted Molly. “But how about the
man who goes in for raising skunks? Guess the
world will beat it the other way from his door,
won’t it?”</p>

<p>It was not that Beth deprived herself of all
social intercourse with her fellows, but she would
not be tempted to put herself forward or be led
into situations where girls of Maude Grimshaw’s
type could snub her. Since that unlucky night of
the first red masque of the term, Beth had been
able to escape Maude’s particular notice.</p>

<p>Yet Maude sat directly opposite Beth at table.
The meals at Rivercliff School were social to a
degree. The girls filed into the dining-room in
perfect order and were seated. At once a hum
of conversation arose. The big dining-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
sounded like a hive of bees. There was no attempt
by the teachers or monitors to quench cheerful
talk and moderate laughter; but even the
primes in their corner could not be boisterous.</p>

<p>Maude Grimshaw gave many exhibitions of her
boorishness; but usually such occurrences escaped
the notice of the teachers. Having put Beth in
what the rich girl considered “her place,” Maude
did not trouble herself further about the girl from
Hudsonvale.</p>

<p>Sometimes the waitresses came in for a taste of
Miss Grimshaw’s sharp tongue. She seemed to
have taken a special dislike to Cynthia Fogg, possibly
because she believed Beth to be a friend of
the freckled girl’s, or because the latter had a perfectly
detached and untroubled way of receiving
Miss Grimshaw’s strictures.</p>

<p>Beth once heard Maude say to Laura Hedden:</p>

<p>“I even dislike the face of that Fogg girl—‘Cynthie,’
do they call her? Do you know, she
has the impudence to look like a very dear friend
of mine.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be!” drawled Laura. “That waitress?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She really does look something like Miss
Freylinghausen. You’ve heard of the Freylinghausens,
of course. Emeline is an heiress half
a dozen times over. She is traveling in Europe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
just now. Oh! we are very good friends. An old
Philadelphia family, you know, the Freylinghausens.
One of the very oldest.”</p>

<p>So Beth thought that perhaps Cynthia’s unfortunate
resemblance to the heiress of the Freylinghausen
millions was rather a drawback.
Maude evidently did her best, on every occasion,
to be unpleasant to this particular waitress.</p>

<p>One evening at supper she called across the
table to Beth and Molly, who sat side by side:</p>

<p>“Say! one of you see if you can wake up that
dummy behind you and get some butter passed this
way. It’s a shame how inattentive that girl is!”</p>

<p>“Whom are you speaking of?” demanded
Molly, coolly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot! She is a friend of a friend of
yours, Miss Granger,” rejoined Maude, sneeringly.
“I mean that big-footed dummy standing
there—in a <i>fog</i>, of course, as usual.”</p>

<p>Laura Hedden and one or two other “Me toos”
giggled. Beth could not see Cynthia, but her own
face flushed. Maude looked scornfully across the
table, taking in all three of the girls she disliked
in this glance.</p>

<p>“I believe you are the very meanest girl who
ever walked on sole-leather!” exclaimed Molly,
but quite low, so that none of the teachers would
hear. “If I were Cynthia I’d box your ears.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“I’d like to see her try it!” cried Maude, her
pale face turning red, as it did in a very ugly
fashion whenever she was angry. “I’d teach her
her place——”</p>

<p>“Are you sure, Miss Grimshaw, that you can
teach me anything?” Cynthia’s low, cultivated
voice broke in, and she laughed, as though the
rich girl’s spitefulness only amused her.</p>

<p>“How dare you speak to me?” demanded
Maude, starting up. “I’ll report you for this.”</p>

<p>“And if you dare, Miss Grimshaw,” said Beth,
quietly, “I shall tell madam just what you said
to her.”</p>

<p>“So will I,” broke in Molly, eagerly. “And
glad to do it!”</p>

<p>Maude hesitated, then sat down. She knew
that with two against her no story she could tell
the madam would hurt Cynthia Fogg.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway,” she grumbled, at last, “let
her pass the butter.”</p>

<p>At that there was general, if subdued, laughter
all about the table; for most of the girls had heard
a part of the controversy. For some time thereafter,
whenever Maude Grimshaw threatened to
fly into one of her tantrums, somebody would be
sure to say:</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, let her pass the butter!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>ANOTHER BARRIER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth</span> went home to Hudsonvale for the winter
holidays, which lasted till the middle of the first
week in the new year. Molly went with her on
the train, as, of course, navigation on the river
had ceased, keeping on to Hambro—and the seven
aunts—farther down the stream.</p>

<p>Beth was delighted to see her father and mother
and the children. And many of her old schoolmates
beside Mary Devine came to see her.</p>

<p>But she did not see Larry. She had heard
from him again, after that first letter; and he had
told her he would be away over the holidays.
Mrs. Euphemia had expressed a sudden wish to
go to Old Point Comfort and had insisted that
Larry go with her.</p>

<p>“And what the Mater says, goes,” he had written
to Beth. “She’s been awfully good to me—especially
since I came home from the law school.
Why! I never could have afforded such a fancy
office if it hadn’t been for her. She’s bribed me
to take this trip; but I don’t really see how the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
local bar is going to get along without me for a
fortnight or three weeks.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Beth felt distinctly disappointed
that Larry was not in Hudsonvale. There was
something lacking in her holiday.</p>

<p>She had but one other source of worriment.
And that she was not sure should be a worriment.</p>

<p>She noticed that her father was thinner, grayer,
and that his walk seemed to have less springiness.
She asked him if he did not feel well, and he
laughed at her. Yet the laugh was not convincing.</p>

<p>She would not whisper to her mother or to the
other children her fears for him. Mr. Baldwin
had always been a thin and wiry man—one of the
kind, as he often said, that wears out, but does not
rust out.</p>

<p>The holidays, however, were gay. Besides a
party given for her young friends by her mother
on Christmas Eve, Beth went to the usual midwinter
ball at the Town House—a very popular
affair, indeed. She wore the poplin, and she
danced many times with the men and boys who remembered
her from the night of Larry Haven’s
“coming out” party.</p>

<p>There was one little thing that, strangely
enough, rather marred Beth’s enjoyment of the
evening. She had never put on her pretty frock
at Rivercliff without wishing that she had her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Great-grandmother Lomis’ corals to wear; and
now she suggested to her mother that she be given
a second chance to display her heirloom.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baldwin suddenly looked troubled—exceedingly
troubled. Hesitatingly, she said: “My
daughter, I do not think it would be wise. You
are really too young to wear such things yet. It
caused, I believe, some comment before.”</p>

<p>Beth laughed. She would not show her mother
how deeply she was disappointed. “I guess it’s
because Mrs. Haven or Larry will not be there,
isn’t it? You wanted to show me off before them.
Now confess, Mother mine!”</p>

<p>Her mother seemed unable to laugh at this
pleasantry. But Beth cheerfully put Larry’s present
into the lace at her bosom and went to the
ball. No taxicab this time, although there was
snow on the ground. She carried her slippers, like
most Hudsonvale people, under her arm.</p>

<p>The holidays slipped away and Beth soon
boarded the train again, finding jolly Molly
Granger, by agreement, in one of the parlor cars.
Molly had a warm invitation for Beth to spend a
part of the summer vacation at Hambro.</p>

<p>“We’ll neither of us get home at Easter, you
know,” Molly declared. “It’s too far to travel,
and the time’s too short. And, as I tell the aunties,
we’ve got to work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“I shall have to work, that is sure,” proclaimed
Beth. “I’m afraid I spent too much money for
Christmas presents. Oh dear!”</p>

<p>“How much money have you earned altogether?”
demanded the curious Molly.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t dare tell you. It might arouse your
cupidity. And there’s only a door between us at
school,” laughed Beth. “But I’ll tell you this:
I put twenty-five dollars in the postal savings bank
at Rivercliff before we came away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cracky-me! What a lot!” cried Molly.
“You’ll be a millionairess yet.”</p>

<p>“Not much, considering what I shall have to
earn before next fall when Rivercliff opens again.
We have to pay half the year’s fees in advance,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it does mean a lot of work for you.
My! the aunties think you are wonderful to do
it.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t done it yet,” sighed Beth. “But I
hope to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope we’ll both have a better half year
this time than the last.”</p>

<p>Beth looked forward with equal hope, too; but
it proved to be dashed within the month. Her
fears for Mr. Baldwin were realized. Her
mother wrote that he was ill.</p>

<p>Beth was in some suspense for several days,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
for the information at first was very meager. But
finally she learned the particulars. Her father had
been taken with a hemorrhage in the shops—a
strain had brought on the attack, the doctors said.
But the trouble was deeper than that.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He must stop all indoor work for months—perhaps
he can never go back to the Locomotive
Works,” Mrs. Baldwin wrote. “It is a sad loss;
of course, they will not hold his situation open.
They never do, no matter how long or how faithfully
a man has worked for that corporation.</p>

<p>“My dear, you must make the most of this
year’s schooling that we have paid for. I am
afraid it will be your last. You cannot look forward
to being a teacher, my poor dear. Marcus
has already got a situation—‘job,’ he calls it. He
insisted. He declares he is going to be the man of
the house till papa gets well.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for you, Daughter—after all your
high hopes. But there must be some good reason
for it and He will not put upon our shoulders a
harder trouble than we can bear.”</p>
</div>

<p>Beth could not agree with this doctrine of her
mother’s. Either she was not sufficiently orthodox,
or she had a clearer vision. She knew her
father had been warned years before by physicians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
that his work was not suited to his constitution.
And Mr. Baldwin had made no attempt to change
it.</p>

<p>“It isn’t fair,” thought the young girl, “to lay
it on God. I could not believe that He is love,
if we suffered such trouble because He willed it.
We have brought it on ourselves—and I guess it’s
our work to hustle around and get the best of this
trouble. Poor papa!”</p>

<p>She wasted no time in useless worry. First of
all, she drew fifty dollars from the bank and sent
it home.</p>

<p>“I will not be behind brave, little Marcus,” she
wrote her mother. “I want you to use this. I can
earn more—a lot more. And I’ll earn all I can
before I come home for the summer.”</p>

<p>She confided in nobody but Molly—and to her
under promise of secrecy. Beth shrank from the
casual sympathy of others. Sympathy of that
quality is so apt to be mixed with curiosity.</p>

<p>Molly was heart-broken. “Beth Baldwin!
you’ll never leave Rivercliff before your three
years are finished—never! Don’t tell me such a
horrid thing!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how it can be helped,” her chum
said. “It is a dreadful blow to my hopes. Don’t
say much about it, Molly dear, or I shall cry.”</p>

<p>Molly was already frankly sobbing. She ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
into her own room and came back again in a moment
with her purse. The contents of this she
dumped into Beth’s lap.</p>

<p>“There!” she sobbed. “You can have all I’ve
got—only say you’ll stay. There’s most as much
as you sent home. I’ll willingly go without bonbons
and ice-cream sodas and furbelows and all
the rest of it, if you’ll take it, dear, and say you’ll
stay the three years out. I’ll give you <i>all</i> my
pocket-money!”</p>

<p>“You dear goosie!” cried Beth, hugging her
closely in her arms. “Oh! how glad I am that I
have such a friend. But I can’t take your money,
Molly. It would be right for neither you nor
for me. You need bonbons and furbelows just
as much as I need money for other expenses. No,
no, dear! ‘Take back thy gold!’ I am Independent
Elizabeth—and you must not tempt me.”</p>

<p>Resolved, as before, to earn all the money possible,
Beth did not neglect her studies. Even Miss
Hammersly had to admit that her standing averaged
better and better as the months went on.
She was among the few first students in the so-called
freshman class.</p>

<p>In Easter week Beth made seventeen dollars
by mending and repairing lace and silk hose. The
news that one of the girls did fine mending spread
outside of the school. Between Rivercliff School<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
and the town of Jackson City was a suburban district
occupied by many wealthy and well-to-do people.
Some orders began to come to Beth from
these households.</p>

<p>The girl sent for a special thread and began to
make a specialty of repairing the fine lingerie of
her more fortunate fellow-students. And this
work increased steadily.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon at Rivercliff was always
free. Beth, as the spring advanced, began to refuse
to spend this holiday with Molly and her
friends. “Four whole hours to myself!” she proclaimed
to her disappointed chum. “I cannot spare
them, my child. I must make hay while the sun
shines.”</p>

<p>“But the sun isn’t shining to-day,” said Molly,
pouting.</p>

<p>“The more reason, then, that I should get my
cured hay in the barns,” declared Beth, with a
grim little nod. “‘Avaunt! Avaunt! I scorn thy
gold, likewise thy pedigree; I am betrothed to
Ben-ja-min, who sails upon the sea,’” quoted Beth
from a burlesque verse that they were fond of.
“Tempt me not, I tell you.”</p>

<p>And on this very Saturday afternoon something
happened that made Beth very glad she had remained
in her own room, working. A pair of
very plump bay horses, drawing an old-fashioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
family carriage, came to the main door of the
school, and a footman as fat as the horses, who sat
beside the coachman fatter still, got stiffly down
and puffed up the steps.</p>

<p>He bore a card which he gave to Miss Small,
who chanced to be in the hall at the moment. The
card read:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ricardo Severn</span></p>

<p>“Does Miss Baldwin live here?” asked the fat
footman, asthmatically.</p>

<p>“There is such a student,” the under housekeeper
said, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“My missus sent me for her,” said the man,
blinking sleepily.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Severn?” repeated Miss Small.</p>

<p>“Oh! who does Mrs. Severn want?” cried
Maude Grimshaw, who chanced to be passing
through the hall and saw the footman’s gorgeous
livery, as well as heard the lady’s name mentioned.</p>

<p>She came swiftly to the under housekeeper’s side
and whispered: “Mrs. Severn is the e-nor-mously
rich old lady who lives on the Boulevard, in the
stone house, with the parrot and a whole raft of
servants. Who does she want, dear Miss Small?”</p>

<p>“Miss Baldwin,” puffed the footman, gloomily.</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Maude, taken aback. Then her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
venomous tongue came to her rescue: “Of course!
She has heard that one of the girls of Rivercliff
goes out to service, I presume,” and she went
away, laughing scornfully.</p>

<p>But Miss Small sent Mrs. Severn’s card up to
Beth’s room. However, Maude wrote home that
day and told about the ridiculous way in which
Miss Hammersly was allowing “a pauper girl
named Beth Baldwin to go out to work by the
day like a common servant.”</p>

<p>As it chanced, Maude’s equally light-headed
mother read this part of her foolish daughter’s
letter to a caller. That caller made inquiries and
learned that Beth came from Hudsonvale. She
knew Mrs. Euphemia Haven of Hudsonvale—had
recently met her at Old Point Comfort.</p>

<p>Immediately, this mutual friend wrote Mrs.
Haven what Maude had written to her mother.
And something came of that!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>MR. DENNIS MONTAGUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly Granger</span> had not left Number Eighty-one
when the maid knocked at her chum’s door
with Mrs. Severn’s card and the message. Beth
was not only surprised, but uncertain as to what
she should do.</p>

<p>“What is it?” whispered Molly, very curious.
“A visitor?”</p>

<p>“Who is Mrs. Ricardo Severn?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I know who she is,” cried Molly. “Such
fun! Doesn’t she want you to come down to the
carriage?”</p>

<p>“No. To go to her house, so the footman
said,” explained the maid. “Mrs. Severn isn’t
in the carriage.”</p>

<p>“But who is she?” repeated Beth Baldwin.</p>

<p>“Just the oddest person you ever saw,” Molly
cried. “You <i>must</i> go, Beth.”</p>

<p>“But, why?”</p>

<p>“She’s got something for you to do, of course,”
Molly said. “And depend upon it, it will be work
that pays well. They say Mrs. Severn’s house is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
just crowded with beautiful things. She’s heard
of you through Mrs. Pepper—you know, the
woman who brought you the baby’s lace dress to
mend that the puppy tried to eat up.”</p>

<p>“Query: Did the puppy try to eat up the dress,
the baby, or Mrs. Pepper?” demanded Beth, solemnly.</p>

<p>“Never mind splitting scholastic hairs,” cried
Molly. “You must go!” and she hurried Beth
into her coat and tam-o-shanter.</p>

<p>When Beth saw the old-fashioned carriage, she
laughed to herself. It was queer. But she noted
that the upholstering of the carriage was very elegant,
indeed, and that the vehicle swung on behind
the fat horses in a very easy fashion.</p>

<p>She was solemnly deposited at the big stone
house on the Boulevard within a short space of
time. The big footman presented her at the front
door where a second footman, in still more gorgeous
livery, passed her into the house and up the
first flight of stairs.</p>

<p>Here a maid received Beth, looked her over
carefully as though she feared the girl might have
dynamite concealed about her person, and doubtfully
announced her as “Miz Baldwig.”</p>

<p>The great room into which Beth was ushered—really
a suite of rooms which had been thrown
into one vast apartment—tapered away from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
first appearance of dim grandeur to a sunny point,
where sat a huge old woman, in a huge morris
chair, with her gouty feet in huge slippers on a
stool, while a green and red parrot, hanging upside
down from its perch, was in a big gilded cage
in the bow window.</p>

<p>Mrs. Severn was a broad-faced woman, with
several small wens on her cheeks, who would have
been very coarse-featured, indeed, had it not been
for the cheerful smile with which she welcomed
Beth.</p>

<p>But she could welcome her in no other way at
first, for as the girl marched down the long room
the parrot, still upside down, sang out:</p>

<p>“Here comes the bride!” and then, in the shrillest
possible whistle, and much out of tune, vented
the Bridal March in a most deafening fashion.</p>

<p>Beth could see that its mistress was trying to
quiet the parrot. She could see Mrs. Severn’s lips
move, and a frown came upon her brow, above
which both her “false front” and her cap were
awry.</p>

<p>Finally, losing all patience, she seized a handy
cushion and flung it with evidently practised hand
at the parrot’s cage. The bird broke off short in
his whistling.</p>

<p>“Drat you, Mr. Montague! Shut up!” cried
Mrs. Severn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Shut up yourself—and see how <i>you</i> like it,”
croaked the parrot; but he desisted after that and
his mistress and Beth could talk.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” was the lady’s first comment as Beth
stood before her. “You are only a child!”</p>

<p>“But grown-up folks are not taught at Rivercliff
School, Mrs. Severn,” Beth returned, with a
smile.</p>

<p>“I suppose that is so,” agreed Mrs. Severn,
laughing. “But they say you are quite wonderful
at mending.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Beth replied. “Only painstaking.”</p>

<p>“Why! I guess that must be wonderful in this
day and generation,” and the lady smiled one of
her rare smiles again. “How pretty you are,
child.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mrs. Severn.”</p>

<p>“I had much your style of looks and figure when
I was your age, my dear,” said Mrs. Severn, complacently.</p>

<p>Beth trembled. Then she remembered that, by
no possibility, was there any blood relationship
between her and Mrs. Severn, so there was hope
that she might not, in the end, acquire the good
lady’s present personal appearance.</p>

<p>“I did not know that any of the students of
Rivercliff had gumption enough to do anything useful,”
went on Mrs. Severn, nodding her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“Take a seat, my dear. Don’t come too near my
gouty foot. Gout runs in our family—and we date
back to William the Conqueror.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the noble Duke of York—he had ten
thousand men!” began the parrot, as though feeling
that something was expected of him to substantiate
his mistress’ appeal to ancient history.</p>

<p>“Shut up, Mr. Montague!” commanded Mrs.
Severn. Then to Beth: “He is a dreadfully saucy
bird. His full name is Mr. Dennis Montague——”</p>

<p>“Dennis Mudd! Dennis Mudd!” shrieked the
parrot.</p>

<p>“There! that wicked nephew of mine taught him
that. Roland Severn has no regard for the dignity
of our family name and history, and Montague——”</p>

<p>“Piffle!” growled the parrot, still swinging upside
down.</p>

<p>Secretly, Beth thought the parrot and the
nephew were probably both right. But she, nevertheless,
liked Mrs. Severn. The lady proceeded
to show Beth that she approved of her at once.</p>

<p>“Now, I want your time each Saturday afternoon—oh,
for some weeks. Until the end of this
term, at least,” said the lady. “I have a number
of table-throws and bureau scarfs and the like,
made in the Irish convents, and the carelessness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
of my maid in putting them aside and having them
laundered by people who did not know their business,
has almost ruined some of the pieces. It is
very particular work.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I cannot suit you on such fine work,
Mrs. Severn,” said Beth. “But I will try, if you
like.”</p>

<p>“That is the right answer,” declared Mrs. Severn,
gaily. “From what Mrs. Pepper showed me
I know you will suit.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“And you will give me each Saturday afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Yes—until supper time. We have to report
at that hour unless we have a special permit from
Miss Hammersly.”</p>

<p>“Very strict, is she?” asked Mrs. Severn.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. She has to be, with two hundred girls
under her care.”</p>

<p>“Quite so. Well, under that cloth you will find
some of the articles to be repaired. Look at them
and tell me what you think?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I have nothing with me to work with,”
said Beth. “You see, I did not know what was
wanted of me.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. That makes no difference. I
have you for the afternoon. Is two dollars for
each afternoon you come, too little, my dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“I should make more than that in my room,
Mrs. Severn,” said Beth, quietly. “I am a rapid
worker, and the girls bring me a great deal of
their mending to do. I should be glad to come to
you each Saturday from half-past one till half-past
five for three dollars. I could not do it for
less.”</p>

<p>“My! that seems a lot for a child to charge,”
murmured the lady.</p>

<p>“You can try me one afternoon if you like, and
decide yourself if my work—and the amount I
do—is satisfactory,” the girl said, with dignity.</p>

<p>“Well,” chuckled the lady, suddenly, “I suppose
I want your company as much as I want anything.
You can talk while you work, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” laughed Beth, her face brightening.
“Conversation will not be charged for extra.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Severn laughed. Immediately Mr. Dennis
Montague began to cackle, and went into a
veritable spasm of laughter which drowned all
other sounds for the nonce. The parrot was a
jealous bird. He cared only to hear his own voice.
Again he was quenched (for the moment) by a
cushion and the undignified command to “shut
up!”</p>

<p>Beth saw that Mrs. Severn’s hands and fingers
were swollen with the gout, too—called by more
plebian patients, “rheumatism.” Beth wondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
if she was ever able to get the several costly rings
which were imbedded in the flesh off those swollen
fingers. Mrs. Severn wore, too, an old-fashioned
“sunburst” of considerable value.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t go,” said the lady, when Beth rose,
considering the bargain completed. “You begin
your work here to-day.”</p>

<p>“But really, Mrs. Severn, I have nothing with
me to work with. And I do not suppose you have
the proper thread?”</p>

<p>“Never mind that!” exclaimed the lady. “You
can talk without a needle and thread in your fingers?”</p>

<p>Beth laughed. “Oh yes. But three dollars for
just talking would be rather an overcharge,
wouldn’t it? And I cannot afford to give my
time.”</p>

<p>“You are not supposed to,” said Mrs. Severn.
“I admire you for knowing your own mind and
sticking to it. I shall pay for your time this afternoon
just the same if you do not work. Tell me,
Miss Baldwin, why do you have to do this sort of
thing? For I suppose you have to. No person
of your age would rather work than play.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Beth, hesitating to take the lady
into her complete confidence on such brief acquaintance.
“I do not do it from choice.”</p>

<p>“Until Mrs. Pepper told me, I had no idea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
that one of the girls at Rivercliff ever did anything
useful.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Severn! that is hard. We are all
learning.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. They stuffed me when I was young
with a lot of nonsense at school. But if the chief
end of a girl’s existence is to get married, what
good do books do her?”</p>

<p>“Why, that isn’t the chief end of girls of to-day,
Mrs. Severn,” laughed Beth. “At least, not
of the girls I know.”</p>

<p>“You do not know many of your fellow-students
very well, do you?” asked Mrs. Severn, shrewdly.
“I know that class of young ladies pretty well.
They haven’t, as a rule, a practical idea once in a
year. But you are evidently different.”</p>

<p>“I am different in that my people are not well-to-do,”
confessed Beth. “I had money enough to
get through one year at Rivercliff. I hoped to
earn enough to pay for two more years. That is
why I began mending for the other girls.”</p>

<p>“And don’t you expect to accomplish your purpose?”
asked the interested lady.</p>

<p>“It does not look so now,” said Beth, sadly.
“My father has been taken ill. His income has
stopped. Had my school fees not been paid until
the end of the term I should have gone home at
once. But I am earning all I can to take home in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
June with me and try to repay the folks for some
of the money they have spent on me.”</p>

<p>Beth then turned the current of the conversation
skilfully and got off the subject of herself and her
poverty. Mrs. Severn was really an idle woman
who craved amusement. She had little within herself
to occupy her mind, and had never learned
to occupy her hands.</p>

<p>Beth extracted some enjoyment out of the afternoon,
however; but when she went the parrot
screamed after her: “I don’t care if you <i>never</i>
come back!”</p>

<p>She thought, too, that the foreign maid looked
at her with a frown as she watched her through the
hall and down the stairs. There were evidently
two jealous individuals in the great stone house
that did not care to see the mistress of it become
interested in a stranger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>SOMETHING UNEXPECTED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Success</span> in life comes from putting to use that
gift, or those gifts, which the individual possesses
and developing such talent to the highest degree
of excellence. That is what Beth had done in
her small way.</p>

<p>The opportunity to darn silk hose had come her
way, and she had a natural taste for such work
and ability in it, as well as considerable training
from her mother. Out of the “silk stocking hospital”
had grown the other mending. She was in
a fair way to earn sufficient money during the
year, in the vacation and all, to carry her through
the subsequent two school years which she had
originally resolved to obtain at Rivercliff.</p>

<p>But Mr. Baldwin’s illness seemed to preclude
such an event. Beth kept bravely on with her
work, but with a new resolve.</p>

<p>She wanted to carry home with her in June as
much money as she could possibly earn with which
to repay the loan she supposed her mother had
made before Beth entered Rivercliff School.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>In writing home Beth said very little about
future plans, or even about her immediate work.
That she was very busy, both with her books and
outside work, they knew. Twice a week she heard
from either her mother or Ella. Sometimes Marcus
wrote.</p>

<p>Marcus was particularly proud of the fact that
he had obtained a paying “job.” He brought his
four dollars home each Saturday night, and felt
himself to be a man.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He is getting to be insufferably important,”
Ella wrote. “If he could raise whiskers there
would be no living in the house with him. I believe
he has been pricing safety razors at the
cutlery store. I tell him he will first have to lather
his face with cream and let the cat lick it off.”</p>
</div>

<p>To tell the truth, Beth felt sometimes that Marcus
was doing much more for the family than she
ever could—and she was so much older. Of
course, if she could have carried through her
plans, in the end she might have been the family’s
main support if her father’s illness continued.
Now——</p>

<p>All her plans had tumbled. She could not see
ahead. Living from day to day was not an easy
thing for Beth Baldwin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>Soon after her father was taken ill she heard
from Larry. He expressed his sorrow for Mr.
Baldwin’s condition; and Beth knew he was at the
Bemis Street cottage just as frequently as before
the holidays. But Larry said nothing in his letter
regarding the change the event of her father’s illness
must make in Beth’s plans for an education.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ella wrote: “Larry comes and potters around
with papa in the old shop, sometimes for a whole
afternoon at a time. I guess his clients aren’t
keeping him so awfully busy. He isn’t so much
fun as he used to be. But the other night he took
all us kids to the picture show.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Baldwin was up and about; but his strength
did not return and the doctor would not hear of
his attempting any regular work. Beth knew her
father had half a dozen different inventions partly
finished—Mr. Baldwin laughingly called them
“dinkuses”—in the old shop in the back yard, over
which he sometimes worked. He never expected
to make anything of the machines.</p>

<p>It was several weeks after Beth began to work
for Mrs. Ricardo Severn on Saturday afternoons
that she heard again from Larry, and that in a
most unexpected way. But first something happened
to Cynthia Fogg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>All this time Beth had sought Cynthia from
time to time when opportunity afforded, and
showed the girl that she felt more than an ordinary
interest in her. Cynthia was not of a particularly
grateful disposition, perhaps; or else she did not
consider that she needed the interest or sympathy
of anybody. But with Beth she was always much
franker than with any one else.</p>

<p>That she made a good waitress or maid it could
not be said with truth. She did not, indeed, seem
to care whether she really suited madam or not.
Yet the madam, so particular and exact with every
other girl on her staff, seemed rather lenient with
Cynthia.</p>

<p>Was it because she felt Cynthia Fogg to be,
somehow, different from the other maids in her
employ?</p>

<p>Beth retained her habit of early rising. Sometimes,
indeed, she worked a little before the first
bell—especially as the days grew longer.</p>

<p>But almost always when she was up an hour or
more before the rising bell rang, she took a run
out of doors—a very excellent practice, indeed,
for one working as hard as she did.</p>

<p>As, at that hour, only the front door was unlocked,
Beth usually ran down that way. So she
frequently saw Cynthia Fogg and spoke to her, as
the latter dusted the furniture and woodwork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>Madam Hammersly, with her cambric handkerchief,
which all her maids learned to fear, was
always up early, and many a little talk did the
madam and Beth have together. Sometimes, too,
would Beth hear her complain to Cynthia of her
lack of attention to her duties.</p>

<p>“I can never teach you the importance of trifles,
Cynthia,” the madam said in Beth’s hearing on
one occasion. “How many months have you been
with me?”</p>

<p>“Almost nine now, Madam,” said Cynthia,
briskly. “We ought to know each other pretty
well, don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Girl! it is only necessary that you should know
your work. My character has nothing to do with
the matter,” said the madam, stiffly.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” drawled Cynthia. “Don’t you see
that it has? If you were not so particular——”</p>

<p>“Cynthia! how dare you?”</p>

<p>“Madam?” replied the freckled girl, raising her
eyebrows and turning the full battery of her saucy
blue eyes on Madam Hammersly.</p>

<p>“If you were not a homeless and friendless orphan——”</p>

<p>“Who has saved almost a hundred dollars out
of her wages these past eight months, Madam, so
don’t let that bother you,” interposed the girl, flippantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“You are discharged!” exclaimed Madam
Hammersly, finding the girl’s impudence past bearing.</p>

<p>“You dear!” retorted Cynthia, in her very pleasantest
tone of voice.</p>

<p>“You shall go at once, girl—this very day!”
and the angry madam almost sputtered.</p>

<p>“I just love you for it!” said Cynthia. “You
don’t know how I have fairly hungered to be discharged!”</p>

<p>She tossed the feather-duster on one of the great
settees, her cap and apron after it, and, humming
a tune, departed for the rear premises. Beth, who
stood by with coat and hat on, had been horrified.</p>

<p>The madam was really in tears—none the less
sad to see because they were tears of rage. Beth
could not forgive Cynthia Fogg for her callousness
and flippancy. But at first she dared not
speak.</p>

<p>When, however, she saw the madam pick up
the duster and attempt to reach the top of the pictures
with it, Beth interfered. She took off her
cap and coat and laid them on a chair. Then she
took the duster from the lady with a decisive hand.</p>

<p>“Let me finish here, Madam Hammersly. I
shall like to,” said Beth. “And I’ll put on Cynthia’s
apron and cap, and do it in style. I am
sorry she has acted so, Madam—and after all your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
kindness to her,” added Beth. “But I dare you
to find any dust after I get through,” and she
finished with a laugh, giving the madam a chance
to recover her wonted calm.</p>

<p>“But, my dear Miss Baldwin,” Madam Hammersly
finally said weakly, “what—what will my
daughter—and the instructors—say?”</p>

<p>Beth looked over her shoulder roguishly. “I
don’t believe they will see me,” she whispered,
“for they are none of them up.”</p>

<p>“But the other young ladies?” put forth the
madam.</p>

<p>“I might say the same about most of them,”
laughed Beth. “But I will say instead: What if
they should see me?”</p>

<p>“It—it might cause comment,” said the madam,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the substitute parlor-maid was going
briskly about the work Cynthia Fogg had left
undone. Madam Hammersly ceased objecting,
sat down upon one of the hall chairs, smoothed out
her black silk dress, and watched Beth.</p>

<p>In twenty minutes the reception hall was finished,
baseboards wiped, and the walls brushed
as high up as Beth could reach with the feather
duster. Then the girl went over the polished balustrade
of the stairway again with the soft dustcloth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“There!” she said, with satisfaction. “I don’t
think you will find any dust here now, Madam.
Try your handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“No, my child,” sighed the lady, nodding her
head. “I have watched you. That is sufficient.
You are thorough. You see the importance of
trifles. I wish I had a girl to train like you.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I could suit you, Madam?” asked
Beth, demurely.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I am sure of it,” cried Madam Hammersly,
vigorously.</p>

<p>“By getting to work at half-past five and working
till seven, I could dust the stairway and hall
and one of the drawing-rooms each morning.
Then, in the hour between three and four in the
afternoon except Saturdays, when I could start
half an hour earlier in the morning, I could do the
other drawing-room.”</p>

<p>“Goodness me, child!” exclaimed the madam,
rising quickly. “What are you saying?”</p>

<p>“I am applying for the position that I see is
open, Madam,” said Beth, laughing. “If you
think I’d suit——”</p>

<p>“But, child!” gasped the madam. “Can you
do it with your manifold other duties?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Beth, laughing outright, “my
mother says that the only people in the world who
find time to do extra work are the busy people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“Perhaps she is correct,” agreed the lady,
though somewhat slowly. “I—I do not know
what to say, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Say yes. I will go right ahead and do the
south drawing-room this morning. Then this
afternoon, in my free hour, I will do the north
room. Is it agreed?”</p>

<p>The madam showed weakness at that moment.
She believed Beth would make a “perfect treasure”
of a parlor-maid. So she said: “Yes.”</p>

<p>Beth ran upstairs just as the rising bell rang,
and removed the cap and apron in her room. She
hid them away and said nothing about the dusting,
not even to Molly.</p>

<p>By “grapevine telegraph” Maude Grimshaw
learned before breakfast that Cynthia Fogg was
going. She was delighted.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you?” she asked loudly, at the
table. “I told you I would not stand that impudent
waitress remaining here. No, indeed!” and
she tossed her head as though it were by her influence
that Cynthia had received her discharge.</p>

<p>“Pass the butter!” said somebody, in a sepulchral
voice, and the whole table tittered, while
Miss Grimshaw flushed red, leaving the table abruptly.</p>

<p>Molly learned that Cynthia would not leave the
premises till afternoon. The down boat stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
at the Rivercliff landing at four-thirty. So Beth
took her time about seeing the departing girl.</p>

<p>Of course, Cynthia was her senior, and, after
all, a much more sophisticated girl than Beth.
Yet the latter felt somewhat responsible for the
freckled one.</p>

<p>At least, had it not been for her and Molly,
Cynthia Fogg would not have come to Rivercliff
School to work. And it hurt Beth to think that
she was going away under such circumstances.</p>

<p>She believed the madam must have really liked
the strange girl, or she would never have kept her
so long; for Cynthia had done none of her work
well. Miss Small whispered that Cynthia had
been the slowest and most careless girl that had
ever worked in the house—and yet Madam Hammersly
had borne with her.</p>

<p>When Beth saw Cynthia to bid her good-bye
she did criticize the freckled girl’s course. “You
might have tried to please the madam—she was
so kind to you,” Beth said.</p>

<p>“Goodness me!” smiled Cynthia. “Are housemaids
ever grateful? I didn’t know it. And, to
tell the truth, Miss Baldwin, I don’t think they
have much to be grateful for.</p>

<p>“I was put at the top of the house to sleep, in
a stuffy little room with a window that would open
only a few inches at the bottom, and with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
coarsest of bed clothing, and a rag of a carpet on
the floor. We were expected to keep our rooms
neat, and there was little pleasure in doing so, for
they were so ugly—and everything in them so
ugly—that one could not make them livable. My
bureau had only three legs and the mirror was
cracked. And in the cold weather! Why, the
halls up there are barely warm. You can’t tell
me anything about what maids have to put up with
hereafter. When I go back——”</p>

<p>“Go back where?” asked Beth, pointedly. “To
the institution you ran away from?”</p>

<p>“Well! And if I did it would be no worse, at
least,” and Cynthia’s wonderful eyes smiled again,
lighting up her freckled face and making it very
attractive for the moment.</p>

<p>“But don’t you worry over what is to become
of me, dear girl! I have nearly a hundred dollars,
and it will last me a long time. I am all
right. I will write you when I get settled.”</p>

<p>That afternoon Beth stole down in Cynthia’s
discarded cap and apron, opened the north drawing-room
and began her dusting. The madam
was on hand, evidently to see if Beth kept her
part of the contract, and hardly had Beth begun
her work when Cynthia, dressed for departure,
appeared in the reception hall.</p>

<p>“Oh, Madam Hammersly!” she said cheerfully,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
“I must bid you good-bye before I go. I hope
you will get another girl to suit you better than I
could—— What! Beth Baldwin? Are you doing
my work?”</p>

<p>“No, Cynthia, I am doing my own work,”
laughed Beth.</p>

<p>“And much better than I could ever do it, I
warrant,” laughed the older girl. “Well, Madam,
I know that you will be perfectly satisfied with
Miss Baldwin. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“That is not the door for the serving people to
use, and you know it well, Cynthia,” said the
madam, her voice shaking.</p>

<p>“Bless your dear heart! I know it,” and Cynthia’s
laugh was mellow and her manner unruffled.
“But I came in this way and I might as well depart
like a lady too.”</p>

<p>Suddenly she seized the madam around the
neck and planted a warm kiss upon either of her
wrinkled cheeks. “You are a dear!” she repeated.
“Good-bye!”</p>

<p>The next moment she had flashed through the
open door and out over the porch and down the
steps—just as a motor-car stopped before the
door. Madam Hammersly stood, actually thunderstruck
at the liberty Cynthia had taken, so only
Beth saw the young man who alighted from the
car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>The chauffeur was about to start again when
Cynthia spoke to him, and then stepped into the
tonneau and was whisked away. For a servant
she certainly was departing in style from Rivercliff
School.</p>

<p>But Beth was looking at somebody besides Cynthia.
She saw the young man turn and stare after
the departing girl; then he came slowly up the
steps.</p>

<p>It was Larry Haven. He caught sight of Beth
standing just inside the hall door and his face
brightened. He sprang forward, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Beth! Why, Beth Baldwin! How lucky to
see you at once!” and Beth met him quite as
warmly, forgetting all about Madam Hammersly’s
presence, and put both her hands—one still holding
the dustcloth—in Larry’s gloved ones.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>THE BURIAL OF FRIENDSHIP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Both</span> the young people were for the moment
quite unconscious of Madam Hammersly’s presence.
They shook hands longer than was necessary,
and burbled inconsequential questions and
answers, as most people do to hide their deepest
feelings. Beth’s black eyes sparkled through a
film of teardrops and Larry’s blue eyes expressed
all the admiration they were capable of showing.</p>

<p>But he said: “How nice to see you again, Beth.
Say! is there a girl going to school here named
Freylinghausen?”</p>

<p>“Freylinghausen?” repeated Beth, puzzled, yet
feeling that the name struck some chord of memory.</p>

<p>“Yes. Miss Freylinghausen, of Philadelphia.
No end of a swell——”</p>

<p>“We have plenty of that kind here, Larry,”
said Beth, her eyes twinkling and the dimples coming
into her cheeks at the call of mischief. “But
I do not think that a girl of that name attends
Rivercliff School.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“Why! I just saw her come out. She passed
me on the steps. She took the car I rode up in
just now,” cried Larry, rather excitedly. “I met
her once with a party of Philadelphians that came
to New York——”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear!” laughed Beth. “That was Cynthia
Fogg.”</p>

<p>“Who was? The girl I met in New York?”</p>

<p>“No. The girl who just went out. She—she—she
has been doing parlor-maid’s work here,
and has just been discharged.”</p>

<p>She said this so low that Madam Hammersly
could not hear it. Then she wheeled and led
Larry toward the austere looking lady in the background.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Madam Hammersly,”
Beth said. “This is my very oldest friend, Mr.
Lawrence Haven. He is just like an elder brother
to me, and comes from my home.”</p>

<p>The madam welcomed Larry with some cordiality.
She evidently liked the young man’s appearance.
After a minute or two of conversation,
Beth asked, placidly:</p>

<p>“May Larry sit down here in the drawing-room,
Madam, while I finish my dusting? We can talk
just as well.”</p>

<p>“Why—yes, child. I see no objection,” replied
the madam, yet looking at Beth oddly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
“Would you not rather postpone the—er—assistance
you were so kindly rendering me until your
guest has gone?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Madam,” Beth said brightly. “Can’t
afford to put it off till later. Mother always says,
‘Later never strikes by our clock.’ And Larry
has often bothered me while I did housework.”</p>

<p>Larry said nothing. His face, however, was a
study. He followed Beth with some hesitation
into the north room. The madam, who believed
in the proprieties, remained just out of earshot.</p>

<p>“Now tell me about everything and everybody,
Larry,” Beth said blithely, recommencing
her dusting. “You may sit in that corner by the
door. I have dusted there.”</p>

<p>“But, Beth!” gasped Larry. “What does this
mean?”</p>

<p>“What does what mean?”</p>

<p>“This—er—masquerade?” he said, pointing to
her cap and apron.</p>

<p>“I’ll have you know, sir, this is no masquerade,”
cried the girl, laughing. “This cap and apron are
the badges of independence.”</p>

<p>“Independence!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I have taken Cynthia Fogg’s place.
She did not suit. I am going to earn real money
by doing parlor-maid’s work—if I can satisfy
Madam Hammersly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“But, Beth!” Larry repeated. “What—what
will people say?”</p>

<p>“What people?”</p>

<p>“The—the young ladies here at school?”</p>

<p>“Why, they don’t care who keeps the furniture
polished,” and Beth laughed again, but she shot
her friend a penetrating glance.</p>

<p>“How about Miss Hammersly—the principal?
I should think she would not allow such a thing.
Why, Beth! it is dreadful!”</p>

<p>“What is dreadful?” she asked him, with sudden
tenseness in her tone. “My earning money in
an honorable way? Why, Larry, you know I
came to Rivercliff with that expectation.”</p>

<p>“But this—er—domestic service,” he said
faintly. Then, with sudden heat: “And is it true
that you go out—by the day—to people’s houses—to
do such work?”</p>

<p>“Not just like this, Larry,” said the girl, gently,
and still watching him covertly.</p>

<p>“But it seems too dreadful! Does your mother
know it?”</p>

<p>“I presume she has her suspicions,” and Beth
laughed shortly.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to offend you——”</p>

<p>“Then let us talk of something else, dear Larry,
for I see that we never shall agree in this matter.
I will tell you that mother borrowed from some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
one four hundred dollars to pay for my first year
at school here. I must pay that sum back, for,
with father out of work, my education must cease
with the completion of the term paid for. Now!
we will drop it. How is father?”</p>

<p>Larry, too, tried his best to get away from the
subject, and to talk pleasantly of home affairs.
But how could he ignore Beth’s domestic activities
when she kept on busily dusting all through his
visit?</p>

<p>The drawing-room was finished, Larry’s call
came to an end, and her free hour was over, all
at the same time. She went composedly with him
to the front door, removing her cap and apron as
she heard the girls come out of the lecture room
above. Madam Hammersly had stolen away and
left them alone.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Larry,” Beth said calmly, giving
him her hand. “Remember me to everybody at
home.”</p>

<p>Larry looked away. He coughed, tried to clear
his throat, attempted to say something, and then
suddenly looked around to find his hand empty
and that the door had been gently closed behind
him.</p>

<p>Beth went trippingly up to her next recitation,
appeared as usual at supper, and spent some time
at her mending afterward. When Molly came upstairs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
the two chums spent an hour conning the
problems for the next day, and Beth showed no
shadow of the pain that throbbed within her with
every beat of her pulse.</p>

<p>When the lights were out, however, and a wind-driven
moon peered in at the window of Number
Eighty, South Wing, it caught Beth Baldwin lying
wide-awake upon her pillow, and that pillow wet
with bitter, bitter tears. She was busily engaged
in burying a friendship that had begun with her
very first childish remembrances.</p>

<p>This day—the one on which Cynthia Fogg departed
and Larry Haven called—was the last day
of mark for Beth in this year at Rivercliff School.</p>

<p>Of course, other important things happened—very
important, indeed, to Miss Hammersly’s
graduating class. But little save lessons and the
usual grind of daily duties seemed to stir the life
of the freshmen and the sophomores.</p>

<p>Beth continued to mend and patch for her clientele
up to the very last week of school. She would
carry home nearly one hundred dollars with her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ricardo Severn had continued to be Beth’s
very good friend. Although the girl earned quite
all she was paid at the big stone house on the
Boulevard in mending Mrs. Severn’s drawn-work
and laces, she was really of the most value through
her cheering presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>But the foreign maid and the parrot continued
to look askance at the pretty schoolgirl, whom the
former continued to announce as “Miz Baldwig.”
As for Mr. Dennis Montague, or “Dennis
Mudd,” as the bird preferred to call himself, he
stared always at Beth with little, evil, red eyes,
and the girl was careful never to go too near when
the cage door was open.</p>

<p>“And, my dear,” begged Mrs. Severn, “don’t
ever ask him if he wants a cracker. That always
throws Mr. Montague into a rage!”</p>

<p>Beth saw Mrs. Severn the Saturday afternoon
before school closed for the year. The lady dismissed
her kindly, making Beth promise that, if
she should come back to Rivercliff for another
term, she would take up her work at Severn Lodge
just where she laid it down.</p>

<p>The parrot yelled after her for the last time,
“I don’t care if you <i>never</i> come back!” The foreign
maid scowled her down the grand stairway;
and Beth went away feeling really sorry to be
parted from Mrs. Severn.</p>

<p>The next few days were those of hurry and
bustle incident to the closing of any large school;
and finally Beth and Molly were off on the <i>Water
Wagtail</i> again for their trip down the river—and
home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>A RENEWED RESOLVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth</span> only half promised to go to Hambro later
in the summer to visit Molly Granger and the
seven aunts. She was not at all sure that she could
accomplish it, for she did not know exactly how
she should find things at home.</p>

<p>Molly said: “If you don’t come, Bethesda, I’ll
advance on Hudsonvale some day soon, with all
the aunts at my back, and like a crew of brigands
we will capture you and carry you bodily away.”</p>

<p>There was more cheerfulness in the atmosphere
at home than Beth expected to find. Mr. Baldwin
had obtained some light work that paid a few
dollars every week, Marcus had been raised by his
employer to five dollars, and the family in the
Bemis Street cottage was getting along fairly well.</p>

<p>Of course, there were no new dresses, and Mrs.
Baldwin was doing her own washing and ironing
with the smaller girls’ help, while what came upon
the table was very plain. “We fortunately have
no rent to pay, and the taxes are small,” Mrs.
Baldwin said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>When Beth produced the hundred dollars she
had saved, her mother really seemed more
troubled than amazed.</p>

<p>“Why—why, Beth! you are quite wonderful.
I will put it with that other fifty you sent——”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you used that?” cried her daughter.</p>

<p>“No, my dear. We have not had to.”</p>

<p>“We’ve nearly half the sum you borrowed for
me, and can soon pay it all back, for I shall get
more work this summer,” Beth declared briskly.
“I shall start right out to call upon the folks in
town and show them the work I can do mending
lace and silk hose and the like. I can make more
at such work, if I can get enough of it to do, than
I possibly could in a store or at the factory.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear child——”</p>

<p>“It is my duty to do it, Mamma—and I love it,”
Beth said firmly. “The money you borrowed was
spent for me. I’ll make up the whole in time.”</p>

<p>“It was not a loan to be paid back—at once,”
said Mrs. Baldwin, desperately.</p>

<p>“Why, Mamma! what do you mean? All loans
must be paid.”</p>

<p>“At least,” the troubled mother hastened to
add: “You are not to try to repay it. This hundred
and fifty dollars you have earned so bravely
in your school year, must be kept to help pay your
next year’s fees at Rivercliff.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“Oh, Mother! I cannot do it,” cried Beth. “I
must help you here. It is only right that I should.”</p>

<p>“Let me be the judge of that, Daughter,” Mrs.
Baldwin said. “I thought you had resolved to
win your teacher’s certificate—and at Rivercliff?”</p>

<p>“But, how can I?” murmured Beth. “It is impossible.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” and Mrs. Baldwin’s eyes
twinkled a little now, “that you have proved quite
the contrary. I am proud of you. You have done
so well according to your school reports, and been
able to earn so much money, too, that I feel you
are to be highly commended. I wonder what
Euphemia will say?”</p>

<p>Beth looked at her mother sharply. In that
moment she guessed half her mother’s secret. The
four hundred dollars had been loaned by Larry’s
mother!</p>

<p>She felt that she could say nothing to her
mother about it. The subject of the supposed loan
and her possible return to Rivercliff in the autumn
was avoided by both of them for a time. Meanwhile,
however, Beth thought deeply about it.</p>

<p>If there was anybody in the world to whom
Beth did not wish to feel indebted, it was to Mrs.
Euphemia Haven. She could scarcely have told
why had she been taxed with the question. She
certainly had no dislike for Larry’s mother; only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
she always felt that the lady was patronizing her
and trying to push her aside.</p>

<p>She might have guessed before, Beth told herself,
that Mrs. Haven was the only person her
mother could possibly have borrowed four hundred
dollars from—and without security. So that
was how, the summer before, Larry had known
that she was going away to school and when, and
so had filled her stateroom aboard the <i>Water
Wagtail</i> with flowers.</p>

<p>Beth suspected, from what Larry let drop when
he called at Rivercliff, that he had come there for
the special purpose of learning if reports his
mother had evidently heard of Beth’s work were
true.</p>

<p>“And he got his answer—with a vengeance,”
sighed Beth.</p>

<p>She believed that now Mrs. Haven must be
sorry that she had lent the money to pay for the
first year’s expenses at Rivercliff. “Of course, my
earning money in the way I do has disgusted her.
And Larry——”</p>

<p>She could not bear to think of her old friend.
Never—till the day she died—could she have just
the same measure of affection for a friend that she
had for Larry Haven!</p>

<p>He must have known that his mother had loaned
the four hundred dollars which Beth had mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
at their last interview—the day Larry
called at Rivercliff School. He knew then that
Beth was intent upon paying that loan with the
money she earned. And here was her mother desiring
her to go on with her education, and so
necessarily postponing the evil day of payment
into the future.</p>

<p>Beth did not know what to do. It was evident
her mother did not wish to discuss the loan—did
not wish to be questioned about it. Beth had been
brought up too strictly to doubt her parents’ judgment.</p>

<p>And now, soon after her return home, came
kind Mr. Lomax, the principal of the high school,
to congratulate her on her standing at Rivercliff.</p>

<p>He brought with him, too, a letter he had received
from Miss Hammersly. Although that
good woman had said nothing to Beth before she
came home for the summer, in this letter she begged
Mr. Lomax to use his influence with Beth’s
family, that they would allow her to complete her
course at Rivercliff.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I do not approve, as a general rule, of my
girls working as many hours or as hard as Miss
Baldwin does to earn money to pay school expenses,”
wrote Miss Hammersly. “Usually, the
girls who have to struggle so to achieve the bare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
necessities through school and college, are the ones
who, after all, gain but a superficial benefit from
the educational courses. The work they must do
to live comes first with them, as is natural. They
fall behind in their school work. Not so with
Miss Baldwin. I am proud of her and I want to
see her finish her course so auspiciously begun.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Somehow, Mrs. Baldwin,” Mr. Lomax said
to Beth’s mother, “you must push Elizabeth on.
She must continue her course at Rivercliff. Why!
it will be a distinct loss to the educational community
if she does not become a teacher.”</p>

<p>“I do not know how that may be,” said Mrs.
Baldwin, quietly; “but I do know that I want Beth
to continue at the school. At first, when Mr. Baldwin
was taken ill, I did not see how we could accomplish
it. But now, by her own exertions, she
has proved that it is possible. Why! she has already
in hand enough to pay the first half of next
year’s expenses.”</p>

<p>So it was settled. Beth renewed her resolve
and, as Marcus said, “buckled down to work.”</p>

<p>She had cards printed, and with them she went
from house to house in the better residential sections
of Hudsonvale and the neighboring towns,
showing samples where she could of her really
beautiful work. Both Mrs. Baldwin and Beth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
had a “sleight,” as old-fashioned people called it,
with the needle—especially on such fine work as
Beth now essayed.</p>

<p>“You work up a good trade this summer,
Daughter,” said the practical Mrs. Baldwin, “and
I’ll hold it for you until next long vacation. Ella
is getting such a big girl now, and Prissy is so
helpful, that I can do it.”</p>

<p>Beth had already shown her own capability in
getting ahead. She was not afraid to ask for
work, and where she was allowed to show specimens
of mending she was almost sure of being
engaged for similar tasks.</p>

<p>One thing she would not do, and her mother
suggested it only once—and that faintly. Beth
refused to take her samples of work to the Haven
place and ask Mrs. Haven to recommend her to
her friends.</p>

<p>Everybody who could afford it in Hudsonvale
went away for at least a fortnight in the summer,
and Mrs. Haven and her son went to some northern
resort soon after Beth came home from Rivercliff;
so it was not strange that Beth saw little of
Larry, even in the most casual way, during the vacation.</p>

<p>She was once during the summer at a simple
evening party, dressed in the poplin, refurbished
with new ribbons, and Larry unexpectedly dropped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
in. He devoted himself to her entertainment for
a part of the evening and, quite as a matter of
course, saw her home.</p>

<p>Both talked very fast, and about perfectly uninteresting
matters, all the way—both too nervous
and excited to know afterward just what either
had said—and parted with a handclasp at Beth’s
gate.</p>

<p>Several times, however, during the later summer,
Larry was at the Bemis Street cottage to see
Mr. Baldwin. Beth’s father and the young man
usually remained closeted together for some time,
and once Mr. Baldwin came into the sitting room
after such an interview, smiling broadly.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you,” he said, “that young chap
has got something in his head that didn’t have to
be put there by a surgical operation!” But just
what he meant by this commendation he did not
explain.</p>

<p>Beth was very successful that summer, and for
a girl, earned a good deal of money with her nimble
fingers. It was a fact that she had remarkable
talent for the occupation she had taken up. People
who own nice laces and the like, are only too
glad to pay a commensurate price for their restoration
by skilful workwomen.</p>

<p>She had put her acceptance of Molly Granger’s
invitation to Hambro off as late in the summer as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
she could. But now, finally, Molly threatened so
seriously to lead a pirate band of aunts into the
Bemis Street camp, that it was decided Beth must
go to her chum’s. And she welcomed the diversion,
too.</p>

<p>She went to Hambro by boat, of course; and
the day of her departure on this outing she received
a letter from long silent Cynthia Fogg. It
was rather a queer letter, too—just as queer as the
girl herself!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Are you going to return to Rivercliff School?”
was a part of the epistle. “I’ve heard your father
is ill and that you are not going back there. Tell
me if this is so at once.... I have a good job
and all is well with me.”</p>
</div>

<p>There was something so insistent about that
question that Beth wrote at once, reassuring her
strange friend, that she was to return to Rivercliff.
Cynthia’s address was on Dekalb Avenue,
Philadelphia. Beth wondered what part of the
city that was—whether it was in the wealthy residential
portion, where presumably Cynthia had
secured her “good job,” or among the poor of
the Quaker metropolis. Beth did not believe that
it could be at the orphanage in which Cynthia presumably
had been brought up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>Beth had looked forward to her visit to Molly
and the seven aunts with a great deal of satisfaction
and curiosity; nor was she disappointed. It
proved interesting and she made seven very lovely
friends. The aunts and Molly lived together in a
big house in the better residential section of Hambro,
and were, indeed, quite the most important
people, socially, in the whole town.</p>

<p>Aunt Celia liked Beth because she really was
a student and loved books. Molly’s eldest aunt
spent her days in a comfortable chair in her own
sitting room, reading—and reading the solid, not
to say stolid works of certain English authors who
have mostly gone out of fashion in this day.</p>

<p>Aunt Catherine—almost always suffering from
a cold in the head and never by any possibility
going out of doors without overshoes—was considered
delicate by all the family. She confided to
Beth her favorite remedies for most diseases, from
cholera to housemaid’s knee.</p>

<p>Auntie Cora was society’s devotee—a little,
bustling woman, who was the cheerfulest company
and never talked of anything that amounted (so
Aunt Celia said) to “a row of beans.” She took
Beth and Molly to afternoon teas to show them
off, and drove with them in borrowed coupés behind
stiff-backed coachmen and footmen through
the pleasant roads around Hambro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>Aunt Carrie, the maritime one, took Beth to her
room and displayed for her admiration much of
the wedding finery she had been preparing with her
own hands through a series of heart-hungering
years, against the time when her captain should
come home and settle down.</p>

<p>“John has not had his own ship very long. He
must first lay aside a competence—and for years
he had a father and a mother to support. But
this voyage to the East and one more will ‘complete
the tally,’ he says,” and she blushed very
prettily, for she was a sweet maiden lady with all
the modesty of a girl.</p>

<p>On a teakwood table in a corner of her room—a
present from the captain, of course—was a mariner’s
chart on which every day was faithfully
pricked the possible course of the ship <i>Rollingsgate</i>—a
huge fourmaster.</p>

<p>“I correct it by John’s letters,” Aunt Carrie
said. “And really, it is quite surprising to see how
close I come to it—sometimes.”</p>

<p>She had learned the elements of navigation, too,
so as to know more about John’s calling. To
Beth’s mind this romance of the maiden lady was
the very sweetest of which she had ever heard.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte, the plump, capable aunt, was
housekeeper, and was of a much more practical
nature than the other “Granger girls,” as Hambro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
people knew them. Aunt Cassie actually had an
attack of croup while Beth was in the house.</p>

<p>“And if you can beat that in August, I wish
you’d tell me!” Molly exclaimed.</p>

<p>Aunt Cassie’s whole existence, it seemed, had
been one series of coughs and colds. Aunt Cyril
was very kind to Beth, but rather aloof. She could
not wholly approve of a girl who did housework
for her school tuition. Yet she was too sweet and
lovable to snub her niece’s chum.</p>

<p>“They are just the sweetest, lovingest dears that
ever lived—all of them!” Beth Baldwin declared
to her mother, when she returned from this visit.
“And the house is full of cats—both living ones
and those Jolly Molly has drawn. The aunts are
too tender-hearted to have a single kitten drowned,
or to destroy even one of Molly’s attempts at
feline portraiture.”</p>

<p>Beth was not in Hudsonvale long this time.
The semester would soon open at Rivercliff, and
she took the boat again for the twenty-four hour
journey up the river.</p>

<p>Beth bade Larry good-bye the evening before
she departed for school, and in full family assembled.
The heart-high courage and happiness
that had attended her first departure for school
was lacking when the <i>Water Wagtail</i> left the Hudsonvale
landing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>But Beth had many things to think of now that
she had not dreamed of the year previous. She
was much older, too—much more than a year
older! And hers was not a nature that “hugged
sorrow to its bosom.” She had too many plans
for the future.</p>

<p>She wished to get to Rivercliff, get settled, and
put out her “hospital” sign. Molly had painted
a new one with an added line:</p>

<p class="center">“<i>First Aid to Lingerie</i>”</p>

<p>She had counted on Mrs. Severn’s work as a
solid asset for her school campaign. Arriving at
Rivercliff on Friday, Saturday afternoon Beth
called at Severn Lodge at her usual hour.</p>

<p>The gorgeously liveried footman let her in—but
she thought his look was doubtful. Before she
could mount the stairs the foreign maid appeared
at the top of the flight.</p>

<p>“Miz Baldwig iz to vait below,” she hissed.</p>

<p>Beth stepped back in surprise. The foreign
person disappeared—then reappeared again. She
brought a folded note downstairs and extended it
at arm’s length to Beth.</p>

<p>“Ze compliments of madam,” said the maid.
Beth unfolded and looked at the note, quite
stunned. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“Mrs. Severn will not again require Miss Baldwin’s
assistance.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was written and signed in the upright, old-fashioned
hand of the lady herself.</p>

<p>As Beth left the house she almost thought she
heard the parrot shrieking after her:</p>

<p>“I don’t care if you <i>never</i> come back!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>SUSPICION HOVERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fortunate</span> it was that lessons began on Monday,
and that there were certain preparations to
be made for them. Likewise, there was some
work for Beth’s nimble fingers, for some of the
girls who had arrived at Rivercliff first, had actually
brought their summer’s mending with them.</p>

<p>“For you do it much nicer than I can get it
done at home, Baldwin,” cried one.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Beth, you are an institution,” Mamie
Dunn declared. “I don’t know what we should
do without you. I, for one, would go in rags.”</p>

<p>So Beth did not have much time to worry over
Mrs. Severn’s odd action. She merely comforted
herself by saying that rich old ladies—especially
with parrots and foreign maids—are apt to be
fanciful.</p>

<p>Miss Hammersly called Beth into her office for
a special interview on one of the days soon after
the opening of the term.</p>

<p>“I am pleased to see you with us for another
year, Beth,” she said, with that shade of cordiality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
with which she always received her second year
pupils. “You have come, I presume, fully prepared
to take up your studies with renewed vigor
and a steady application?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, Miss Hammersly,” Beth said cheerfully.
“I love to study.”</p>

<p>“And you will—ahem!—make no engagements
which will interfere with recitations or study
hours?”</p>

<p>“No,” and Beth flushed a little. “Madam
Hammersly tells me she has engaged a girl to do
my dusting.”</p>

<p>“Yes; at my suggestion,” said the principal.
“Besides, I think it debarred you from proper
physical exercise—which you need, Beth.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Hammersly. I will try to make it
up in some other way,” said the girl, doubtfully.
With both Mrs. Severn’s work and the dusting
lost, Beth was worried about the future.</p>

<p>“By the way,” Miss Hammersly said. “Do you
help Mrs. Ricardo Severn this fall?”</p>

<p>For some reason Beth could not keep from
blushing. “No, Miss Hammersly,” she said. “I
expected to, and I went to her home on Saturday
prepared to do so; but I was informed that my
services were not wanted any more.”</p>

<p>“By whom were you so informed?” the principal
asked quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“Why, Mrs. Severn really told me herself—in
writing. She sent down a note,” said Beth, somewhat
surprised at the interest the principal of Rivercliff
displayed in the matter.</p>

<p>“You—are you familiar with Mrs. Severn’s
handwriting?” questioned Miss Hammersly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. She has sent me notes before.”</p>

<p>“Do you not think it strange, Beth?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es; in a way. But I know she is notional.”</p>

<p>“Did you know that she sent here after you in
June—the very day after the school closed?”</p>

<p>“Sent for me?” cried Beth, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why—how odd! She knew I was going away.
I bade her good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Of course, you can imagine no reason for her
treating you so now?”</p>

<p>“None at all. Unless she may have found somebody
else to amuse her. I do not really think,”
confessed Beth, flushing again, and dimpling, “that
it was my work she cared for so much as my chatter.
She likes to be amused.”</p>

<p>Miss Hammersly smiled—yet her gravity returned
instantly. “Very well,” she said, tapping
on her desk with her pencil in a thoughtful way.
“You may go, Beth.”</p>

<p>Beth continued at times to wonder about Mrs.
Severn’s refusal to see her when she called. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
she could not understand. She believed that the
foreign maid did not like her and might have influenced
Mrs. Severn against Beth herself by some
means, although the girl could not imagine how.</p>

<p>The opening of a new school year is like the
picking up of scattered stitches with a knitting
needle. Not only must the mind become attuned
to lessons and to discipline again, but one’s former
friends must be greeted, new friendships
made, and—unfortunately—old enmities and
feuds attended to.</p>

<p>Rivalries always will exist where youths congregate—in
school, or elsewhere. The very system
of education followed at Rivercliff fostered rivalries.
And a healthy competition between students
is always of benefit.</p>

<p>Warped and selfish natures, however, can never
enter into any struggle and play the game with
fairness. The “give and take” of the playground
can never please these.</p>

<p>Although Miss Hammersly and her instructors
watched the two hundred and more girls at Rivercliff
School as closely as was wise, they could not
foresee all feuds nor could they break them up
when once started. Maude Grimshaw and her
friends continued at times to vent upon Beth their
spleen; and occasionally they succeeded in ruffling
the placid surface of Beth’s life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>Ordinarily, “Princess Fancyfoot,” as Molly
called Maude, was content to lift her sharp nose to
a more acute angle when she noticed Beth or to
cast a slurring remark or two in her direction.
These attentions Beth did not allow to trouble her
soul.</p>

<p>She seldom came in direct contact with Maude.
To tell the truth, Maude was not a brilliant
scholar. Beth and Molly were forging far ahead
of the heiress to the Grimshaw millions. Molly
had been fired by Beth’s example and wished to
become self-supporting, too; and was preparing
herself to teach.</p>

<p>“I don’t care what Aunt Cyril says,” Molly announced.
“She thinks it beneath a Granger to
earn money at any occupation. Aunt Charlotte is
more practical. She tells me she will take the
money I earn teaching and invest it for me so that
it will earn at least seven per cent. Then, she says,
I will have something to make me independent in
my old age. For, you see, Bethesda, my father
spent all his patrimony on the heathen, so I have
nothing but what the aunts give me.</p>

<p>“It looks as though Aunt Charlotte had an uncanny
belief that I shall remain an old maid like
all the other ‘Granger girls,’” and she made a little
face at the thought.</p>

<p>With all her hard work at her books and in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
“hospital,” Beth went in for at least one relaxation.
She played an excellent game at basket-ball,
and there was great rivalry at Rivercliff in this athletic
pastime.</p>

<p>Beth and Molly had won places on the second
basket-ball team and, now that a class had graduated,
there was an opening on the first team.
This team played championship games against club
teams in Jackson City and other first school teams
about the State. Basket-ball was a game of which
Miss Hammersly herself particularly approved.</p>

<p>The rivalry for the post of honor on the first
team waxed high during the first four weeks of
the term. The first regular game of the season,
with a team from the Jackson City Academy, was
to be played on one of the Rivercliff courts.</p>

<p>The chums in Numbers Eighty and Eighty-one,
Maude Grimshaw, who could be active if she so
chose, Stella Price, and a girl named Pratt, were
the contestants for the place of honor on the first
team.</p>

<p>Between Beth and Molly it was just a zestful
rivalry for first place; the chums were, of course,
good natured about it. There was some acerbity
between the others, perhaps. In the case of
Maude, she naturally fought “tooth and nail,” as
Molly said, and was as unpleasant about it as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>The physical instructor, Miss Crossleigh, and
the other members of the first basket-ball team,
decided by vote for the girl who was to make the
team. Each candidate who was passed by Miss
Crossleigh, was tried out in practice games before
the last Saturday in September.</p>

<p>On that day Molly came to the breakfast table
a little late, both flushed and excited.</p>

<p>“Well! it’s all over, girls,” she confided to the
table in general.</p>

<p>“What’s all over—the sky?” giggled one of her
hearers.</p>

<p>“The contest for the first team. Miss Crossleigh
has just written up the names on the gym
board. It’s all over but the shouting.”</p>

<p>“Oh! who’s got it?” cried two or three at once.</p>

<p>Maude stopped eating and flashed a look at
Molly. “I’d like to know what you know about
it?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I tell you Miss Crossleigh has just written up
the names of the girls who will play Jackson City
next week.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the new one? Not you, Molly, I’ll be
bound,” cried Stella Price.</p>

<p>Molly could no longer control her smiles. Yet
she said, a bit ruefully:</p>

<p>“Not guilty! Poor lil’ Molly wins not, of
course. She never does.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“Who is it?” demanded Maude, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why, Maude! who could it be?” drawled
Molly, wickedly. “There was never but one girl
of us that really had a chance from the start.”</p>

<p>Maude’s complacent and conscious expression
was delightful.</p>

<p>“Of course, I knew——” she began, with a toss
of her head, when Molly interposed with:</p>

<p>“We all knew! Hail to the chieftainess!
Beth! get up and bow. <i>You’re elected.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>What?</i>” shrieked Maude.</p>

<p>“How horrid!” exclaimed Laura Hedden, loyally.</p>

<p>A general laugh went around the table.
“Speech! Speech!” clamored the girls.</p>

<p>Beth got up, flushing, and bowed with mock
solemnity. “I am overpowered,” she said. “You
must excuse me. Besides, I am hungry.”</p>

<p>“Well! if that isn’t the very meanest thing!”
hissed Maude Grimshaw. “That pauper has no
more right to the place than—than——”</p>

<p>“Pass the butter!” advised Mamie Dunn,
springing the old joke on Maude.</p>

<p>Maude, however, was not to be so easily silenced
on this occasion. She rose up haughtily, her
usually colorless face ugly with splotches of red.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you—all you smarties,” she said,
greatly enraged—“that this has been a most unfairly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
conducted contest. You all know it. Success
has not gone to the best player, but to one
who is, in some mysterious way, momentarily popular.
Perhaps it is out of pity for her poverty
that Miss Baldwin has been given the place on the
first team, a place that belongs to a better player.”</p>

<p>“Yourself, for instance?” drawled Molly.
“With two fumbles and three interferences to your
credit when you were last tried out?”</p>

<p>“Not my fault!” snapped back Maude.</p>

<p>“Oh, hush, Grimshaw!” advised a senior.
“You’re making yourself ridiculous; don’t you
know that? And Miss Carroll is looking this
way.”</p>

<p>“Let Miss Carroll hear,” hissed Maude. “All
the teachers had better hear. We are supposed
to be decently honest in this school; but all of us
are not.”</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” interposed somebody, <i>sotto
voce</i>. “Confession is good for the soul.”</p>

<p>“You think you are smart!” flared up Maude,
looking around without identifying the speaker.
“But perhaps it would be just as well if some inquiry
were made as to why this new member of the
first basket-ball team came to be turned out of Severn
Lodge and forbidden even to go there again.
Oh! I know what I am talking about—and so
does she.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>With this last phrase spoken in a most insolent
way, Maude stalked from the table. Molly
jumped up to follow her, “spitting like a bad firecracker,”
as somebody said; but Beth pulled her
back into her seat.</p>

<p>“Now Maude’s exploded again,” said Stella,
wearily. “Don’t follow her example please,
Molly Granger.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! she is not worth worrying about, Miss
Baldwin,” declared another girl.</p>

<p>But a whisper went around the table. It had
an echo, too, in Beth’s heart:</p>

<p>“What did Maude mean about Severn Lodge?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>THE TRAITOR’S BLOW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth</span> really had her heart and mind so full
these days that there should not have been room
for worry over anything that a girl like Maude
Grimshaw could say. The fact remained, however,
that Beth was disturbed by Maude’s innuendo.</p>

<p>Molly had asked: “What could that nasty thing
mean, Beth, about Mrs. Severn?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” her chum honestly replied. “I
can’t imagine.”</p>

<p>“Humph! just some of her spleen, I guess.
She’s heard you weren’t working there any more
on Saturdays and so just made something up out
of whole cloth.”</p>

<p>So they passed it over. Molly evidently heard
no more about it during the next week, for she did
not broach the subject again to Beth. But the
latter felt that there was a cabal of some nature
against her among Maude’s “Me toos.”</p>

<p>Beth practised with the first basket-ball team
every day, and Miss Hammersly herself came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
watch the play and pronounce judgment. She was
very much pleased with the smooth work of the
five and applauded vigorously.</p>

<p>The whole school took a deep interest in the
practice games; but the general applause grew
noticeably fainter day after day, when Beth
chanced to make a good play. Molly Granger and
a number of her close friends, who were frequently
on the side lines together, cheered Beth to the
echo. But they finally became quite alone in their
applause.</p>

<p>Beth herself had noticed the coldness of her
fellow-students before this. She discovered it in
other ways besides the lack of applause on the basket-ball
court.</p>

<p>A girl who had promised her some work did not
bring it to Number Eighty and Beth asked her
about it.</p>

<p>“Miss Rice, I can mark those handkerchiefs for
you now, if you like,” Beth said. “Shall I come
for them, or will you bring them to me?”</p>

<p>The girl spoken to flushed and hesitated. “Oh—I—well—I’ve
changed my mind, Miss Baldwin,”
she stammered. “I guess I won’t have them
done just now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” laughed Beth, “if it is a matter
of a lack of the essential pin-money just now, I’ll
trust you. I have to do such work when I can, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
know, and often we girls have spent all our immediate
allowances.”</p>

<p>“No, Miss Baldwin. I don’t want the handkerchiefs
done at all,” said Miss Rice, tartly. “I
prize them rather highly—they were sent to me
from Paris. I don’t think I care to risk them out
of my own possession.”</p>

<p>Nothing could be plainer than this. Beth was
aware that Miss Rice was frequently in Maude
Grimshaw’s company. The lesson to be drawn
was obvious.</p>

<p>All the girls of Rivercliff were not followers of
“Princess Fancyfoot.” Yet it was plain enough before
the day of the game between the school’s first
team and the one from Jackson City, that Beth
was not a favorite on the basket-ball team.</p>

<p>Whether Miss Crossleigh, the instructor, noticed
it or not, she said nothing. Teachers cannot
always take note of girlish feuds and rivalries.</p>

<p>A match game between the teams of rival
schools brought to the Rivercliff athletic field many
friends of the girls. Miss Hammersly had had a
grand stand erected to overlook both the basket-ball
and tennis courts, which were inside the cinder
path. The weather was fine, the sport was popular,
and the field made a brilliant picture on this
crisp October afternoon.</p>

<p>Beth’s mates on the basket-ball team showed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
frank good fellowship—that was one good thing.
Otherwise, she could not have played as brilliantly
as she did that day. The opposition to her that
developed among her own fellow-students as the
game went on only served to spur her to greater
efforts.</p>

<p>In the first half the Rivercliff team was outmatched.
There was a weak spot in the home
team, but not in Beth Baldwin’s corner. Yet almost
the whole school was unfriendly toward her.</p>

<p>“All ready?” demanded the referee, and at the
signal the ball was thrown into play.</p>

<p>Although the play was fast and furious from
the very start, at first neither side scored. Then
the umpire halted the play with:</p>

<p>“Foul on Rivercliff for over guarding!”</p>

<p>It was really a shock to the school five. “Do
get together, girls!” begged Maxine Laval, the
captain.</p>

<p>But their opponents got the ball and shot it
basketward. Right from the field the Jackson
City Academy five made a basket. And following
it—within a half minute—they made a second.</p>

<p>“Break it up, guards! Do!” groaned Maxine.</p>

<p>Maxine herself made a brilliant play the next
moment, and her friends on the benches and side
lines showed their approval wildly. And then a
basket was made splendidly by Beth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>Silence. For a moment, dead silence. Then
Molly led a weak and forlorn applause. But the
snub of the little brunette beauty, who was playing
so well and vigorously, was so plain that the entire
audience marked it.</p>

<p>Whispering among the elders, laughter among
the girls, followed the incident. The whistle
called the half with the home five badly behind.
The visitors scored six points over them.</p>

<p>In the dressing room allotted to the Rivercliff
five, Miss Crossleigh thanked them for their work
and encouraged them.</p>

<p>“There seems to be some schoolgirl foolishness
afoot,” the instructor added, rather sharply. “One
of us seems to be unpopular——”</p>

<p>“Miss Crossleigh,” said Beth, quickly, “if you
think that I had better retire and let a substitute
take my place——”</p>

<p>“No, no!” the other girls of the team cried.</p>

<p>“Why, Beth Baldwin!” Maxine said, warmly,
“you have done better than any of us. Isn’t that
so, Miss Crossleigh?”</p>

<p>“I will not say that,” said the lady, smiling.
“You have each done your best, I believe, and I
want you to keep at it. Show them that although
they may win this game from us you are all good
sports. Of course, Miss Baldwin will finish the
game.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>And cheered somewhat by this, when the whistle
announced the game was on for the second half,
Beth went out with renewed vigor. Almost at
once she got another basket. This time there was
a pronounced hiss from one group on the benches.
Needless to say Maude Grimshaw was the central
figure of that group.</p>

<p>But the friends of the visiting girls began to
understand the opposition to Beth by her own
party. They applauded Beth themselves, and
when the game was over (and it was not such a
bad beating the Rivercliff team received, after all,
thanks to Beth’s good playing), every member of
the opposing team insisted upon shaking hands
with the girl who had fought them the hardest.</p>

<p>Almost everybody was late to supper that evening;
but notably the losing team in the afternoon’s
game, and Maude Grimshaw and several of her
“Me toos.” In fact, Maude herself did not appear
at all, and Miss Carroll slipped into her place
at table.</p>

<p>“That table would have just buzzed if Carroll
hadn’t sat there,” Molly Granger announced, when
the meal was over and the girls were trooping upstairs
to the general recreation room on the second
floor.</p>

<p>The elements of the game that afternoon were
busily discussed; but as several of the teachers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
were present right up to the time the half-past
eight bell rang, when the girls retired to their
rooms, any particular talk regarding Beth had to
be postponed by either friends or enemies.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>BEFORE THE JUDGMENT SEAT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for Beth herself, when she left the table,
Miss Carroll spoke to her:</p>

<p>“See Miss Hammersly in the office at once, Miss
Baldwin. It is imperative.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Carroll,” Beth said, and went to
the interview with apparent calmness.</p>

<p>Miss Hammersly was sitting under the shaded
light at her desk, making notes upon a tablet. As
Beth entered, the school principal arose quickly so
that the shadow fell across her face, while the girl
stood in the full glare of the lamp.</p>

<p>“Beth!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Hammersly.”</p>

<p>“I have called you here upon a serious matter.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the meaning of this afternoon’s
exhibition of disloyalty and bad taste on the athletic
field?”</p>

<p>Beth did not dodge the issue. “I understand,
Miss Hammersly,” she said, “that some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
girls say I am dishonest. It has something to do
with Mrs. Severn. What it means, I do not
know.”</p>

<p>Beth’s lips were quivering, but she spoke
bravely. Miss Hammersly stared straight at her
for fully a minute. She saw the black eyes dim,
lose their sparkle, and overflow with slow tears
that found their courses, one by one, down the
girl’s cheeks.</p>

<p>The principal of Rivercliff School was not given
to sentiment—as a practice. But she suddenly
came close to Beth and put both arms about her in
a motherly way.</p>

<p>“My poor child!” she said. “You are much to
be pitied, I believe. I know that you are maligned.
You have no knowledge at all of what this exhibition
against you on the part of your schoolmates
means?”</p>

<p>“Not at all, Miss Hammersly.”</p>

<p>“We will see Mrs. Severn together and find out
the facts,” declared the principal.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Severn!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Some of your schoolmates have got hold
of something that evidently had its origin at Severn
Lodge. It came by way of the back stairs, of
course—from one servant to another. It is disgraceful
enough,” continued Miss Hammersly
with indignation, “that any of my girls should listen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
to servants’ gossip; and worse still that they
should allow it to influence their minds against a
fellow-student.</p>

<p>“We cannot call on Mrs. Severn to-night, Beth.
She is a semi-invalid and probably retires early.
But we will go to-morrow afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Hammersly! It is so kind of
you——”</p>

<p>“No, Beth. I cannot claim any such virtue in
the case. I must defend the characters of my
pupils for my own sake—for the school’s sake.
And in this case, my dear, I will defend you for
your sake; for I am sure you are guiltless of any
intended wrong.”</p>

<p>Miss Hammersly and Beth went together in an
automobile the following afternoon to Mrs. Severn’s
home. It was true that, when they entered,
the footman seemed to place himself before Beth
as though to ward her from the stairs, while the
ever-watchful foreign maid hissed from the head
of the stairs:</p>

<p>“Miz Baldwig ees not to come up, Jeems!”</p>

<p>But Miss Hammersly handed her card to the
footman, saying sternly:</p>

<p>“Announce me to your mistress. Give that card
to nobody else!”</p>

<p>The maid, casting a malevolent glance at Beth,
backed out of sight. The big footman started up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
the stairs, the very calves of his legs in their silk
stockings trembling in indignation. But the school
principal and Beth were immediately ushered into
the presence of the mistress of Severn Lodge.</p>

<p>Mr. Montague, upside down as usual, shrieked
a greeting in his most appalling fashion. The
gouty one threw a cushion at his cage; but possibly
owing to nervousness, she missed it.</p>

<p>“Shut up, Mr. Dennis Montague!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Dennis Mudd! Dennis Mudd!” screamed the
parrot. Then, soulfully:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent">“The noble Duke of York,</div>
<div class="indent2">He had ten thousand men,</div>
<div class="indent1">He marched them up a hill one day,</div>
<div class="indent2">Then he marched them down—</div>
<div class="verse">Too-roo-lal-roo-lal-larry! Johnny come home to tea!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>After this long speech the creature was breathless,
and the lady of the mansion and Miss Hammersly
could converse. The former asked neither
of her guests to sit down, nor did she, indeed,
glance at Beth.</p>

<p>“I do not understand this call, Miss Hammersly!”
said Mrs. Severn, haughtily.</p>

<p>“I propose to explain myself very quickly,
Madam,” said the school principal, quite as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
haughtily. “When you sent to inquire of me regarding
Miss Baldwin last June, after she had
gone home, why did you not explain your reason
for so doing? Why leave me to find out this calumny
against one of my pupils, Mrs. Severn, until
now, and through such mean channels?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Miss Hammersly, by
‘mean channels,’ pray?” croaked Mrs. Severn.</p>

<p>“Pray! Pray, I say!” croaked the parrot, in a
voice scarcely less harsh.</p>

<p>“Shut up, Mr. Montague!”</p>

<p>“Shut up yourself!” returned the parrot, who
had now come out of the cage and was walking
along the mopboard of the room, pecking at the
carpet.</p>

<p>“I do not think I need explain,” said Miss Hammersly.
“Through your servants the story has
reached my serving people, and, of course, some
of the more thoughtless of my girls. Miss Baldwin
does not know now of what you accuse her.”</p>

<p>“She should be glad I did not send a policeman
after her!” cried Mrs. Severn, in weak rage.</p>

<p>“You should be glad, Madam, that I do not institute
suit for slander against you on Miss Baldwin’s
behalf—and that I certainly will do if you
continue to repeat your accusation.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Hammersly!” begged Beth, in tears
now. “Of what am I accused?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“Of stealing a diamond sunburst. She says it
is missing since the last Saturday you were here
in June.”</p>

<p>Beth’s gaze flashed to the neck of Mrs. Severn’s
gown. The old-fashioned pin she usually
wore was missing.</p>

<p>“Oh! that is awful!” the girl murmured.</p>

<p>“No, it is not,” Miss Hammersly said sternly.
“It is merely unjust—and actionable. I have
come here to tell you, Mrs. Severn, that you must
write Miss Baldwin an apology, stating that you
have no evidence that she had anything to do with
the disappearance of your pin. This disavowal
I will read to my girls. And I will send home any
one of them who dares repeat the calumny upon
Miss Baldwin’s character.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Severn, very angry, tried to be dignified,
while the parrot went into a spasm of laughter in
the corner of the bay window. But Miss Hammersly
had been managing people—and getting
her own way with them, too—for twenty years.
She and Beth finally left the house with just the
paper the school principal had demanded.</p>

<p>On Monday morning after prayers, Miss Hammersly
gave the entire school a lecture on the evils
of gossip and read Mrs. Severn’s written acknowledgment
of the wrong she had done Beth. Maude
Grimshaw was very much subdued just at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
time. If the story of the lost pin and the accusation
against Beth was repeated, it was done so in
secret, thereafter.</p>

<p>The wound, however, remained open in Beth’s
soul. It was hard for even such a sweet nature
as hers to overlook and forgive the treatment she
had received at the hands of many of her schoolmates.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>ROUNDING OUT ANOTHER YEAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may have been well for Beth Baldwin’s advancement
in her studies and for her financial
prosperity, that the foregoing incidents had taken
place. It shut the young girl more within herself
and left her mind freer for study and work.</p>

<p>Those girls who were sorry and ashamed because
of countenancing a mean act, even to a slight
degree, tried at first to shower favors upon the
occupant of Number Eighty, South Wing; at least,
they all brought her work for her needle. But
Beth knew her friends now—there was no question
of that. They were few, and they were loyal, but
they took up very little of Beth’s time.</p>

<p>As the term progressed she secured other and
better paying occupation for her free hours, and
outside of school. But she heard nothing more
from Mrs. Ricardo Severn nor of the lost sunburst.</p>

<p>Molly and she sometimes talked about it. The
mystery, if not the suspicion, still overhung Beth.
She was inclined to believe that the foreign maid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
might know more about the disappearance of the
sunburst than anybody else.</p>

<p>“She may not have stolen it because she wished
to profit financially by the deed,” Beth said to
Molly. “But for some reason she always showed
her dislike for me, and she may have done this deliberately
to ruin me in Mrs. Severn’s estimation.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know who else would have done it—unless
it was that parrot you tell about,” Molly
said, laughing shortly.</p>

<p>Beth did not go home for the Christmas holidays
because of her outside work, and at Easter,
the intermission was too short to make a visit to
Hudsonvale worth while.</p>

<p>News from home continued to be encouraging
throughout the school year. Mr. Baldwin steadily
improved in health, for he worked out of doors.
He never went back to the Locomotive Works,
but the family managed very well, indeed. There
was hope of something being done with one of
his inventions. Larry Haven had an interest in
that, and Beth knew that Larry had supplied the
funds for the patent fees and other necessary expenses
connected with the matter.</p>

<p>On her part, Beth was doing splendidly. Miss
Hammersly was vastly pleased with her standing
in her classes. From the time they had visited
Mrs. Ricardo Severn—and Mr. Montague—together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
Beth and the school principal had been
very good friends, indeed. Miss Hammersly seldom
displayed so much affection for any pupil as
she did for Beth.</p>

<p>Molly was doing well, too, and at the close of
the second year in June Beth stood first in her
class and Molly was not far down on the roster.</p>

<p>“But it never <i>would</i> have happened, Bethesda,
if it hadn’t been for you. I was ashamed to be left
so far behind a girl who had so much on her hands
when I had so little. But I am afraid it has made
me very serious-minded,” and she shook her head
gloomily.</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense, Jolly Molly!” laughed Beth.
“You will never be a ‘grave and reverend seignior’—and
because of more than the disbarment of
sex. A <i>senior</i> you will be; but always a jolly one.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, my child!” quoth Molly. “When I
come back to Rivercliff next autumn, I shall begin
signing myself, ‘J. Molly Granger.’ I shall abandon
my full name, and let my jocundity be represented
by an initial only.”</p>

<p>When Beth went to Hambro that second summer,
however, for a brief visit with Molly and
the aunts, she could not descry much change in her
chum.</p>

<p>The summer was a busy one and a happy one
for Beth. Her mother had held together the customers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
Beth had obtained the year previous. Indeed,
there was a neat sign on the front door of
the Bemis Street cottage, and almost daily carriages
and automobiles from the better residential
section of the town stopped before the house.
Ella was learning to help in the work, too, and little
Prissy was becoming a perfect housewife. The
twins, Ferd and Fred, were sturdy youngsters,
going to school and being helpful in vacation time
in the garden. Marcus was a manly fellow and—whisper!—he
had actually bought a safety razor!</p>

<p>That summer Beth found that she was more
popular than ever in her home town. Mr. Lomax
asked her to meet his class of girls who would
graduate from the high school the next year, and
tell them something about what it meant to attend
a boarding school. It was at a lawn party, and
a good many older people were present.</p>

<p>Beth did her best to inspire the girls with a
desire to do as she had done. Some of them
would have to follow her methods to a certain extent,
for their parents were too poor to pay their
full tuition at any school or seminary.</p>

<p>“I believe the prize is worth the work entailed,
however,” Beth said, in the course of her simple
address. “If I could not go back for my final
year at Rivercliff I should feel well repaid for my
struggle thus far. But if I am allowed to finish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
my course, I know I shall be better able to face
the world and make my own way in it than I possibly
could do if I had been prepared by any other
means.</p>

<p>“The business college course is cheap and
quickly gained; but the classical and English
courses in a properly conducted school which confers
an academic degree fit one for a better and
higher position in business or professional life.”</p>

<p>Rather to her chagrin, but to Ella’s great delight,
the county paper printed Beth’s speech in
part. The flyaway sister went around repeating
extracts from it, and proclaiming to all who would
listen that Beth was bound to be an orator.</p>

<p>“A lecturer, anyway,” she insisted. “Our Beth
will soon adorn the platform. In spectacles and
a cap and gown, she will lead her sisters in charges
for women’s rights, lecture on the noise nuisance,
plead before legislatures for freedom from the
trammels of fashion——</p>

<p>“By the way, B. B., Larry says that frock of
yours is just stunning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, does he?” returned her sister, placidly.</p>

<p>“Yes. I think you are snubbing Larry.”</p>

<p>“I have no time for boys,” responded Beth.</p>

<p>“Boys! No less!”</p>

<p>“Larry is a boy to me,” Beth declared, in her
very haughtiest way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“I don’t care,” said Ella, mischievously. “He
is beginning to come to me for comfort when you
throw him down.”</p>

<p>It really did seem as though Larry Haven was
striving to show Beth that he had not lost his interest
in her or in her career. When Beth first
came home that second summer, Larry was frequently
at the Baldwin cottage. Whether Beth
actually snubbed him, or not, as Ella said, he disappeared
soon after, going away for a long outing
with Mrs. Haven; so the Baldwins did not see him
again until Beth had gone back to Rivercliff in
September.</p>

<p>Rather to Beth’s surprise, Larry wrote to her
soon after she reached school—something he had
not done for fully a year and a half. The letter
sounded just as though their old intimacy had
never been broken, and that the young lawyer was
still quite as much her friend and well-wisher as
ever.</p>

<p>She was, for some time, undecided whether to
answer or not, and how to answer. But finally
she replied in a pleasant, brief letter. Larry’s
epistle was like himself—exuberant:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Mater lugged me around from one watering
place to another this summer—there was no
getting away from her, poor dear!—and kept me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
at it so late that you had flitted from the home nest
on Bemis Street when I got back to Hudsonvale
and my clamoring clients. I never go away on a
vacation without expecting to find the heaped-up
bodies of exhausted and desperate clients before
my office door in the Hudsonvale Block. However,
all I found were several insistent roaches
from the bakery downstairs and heaps of dust, for
I declare, Devine had not been in to clean up for
a month!</p>

<p>“What I started to tell you about, Beth, was a
girl I met at Saratoga. Fact is, it was the second
time I had met her. I am almost tempted to declare
it was the third. I spoke to you once of
Miss Emeline Freylinghausen. Do you remember
the girl who passed me coming out of Rivercliff
School when I was going in the day I called
to see you? Do you remember her? You said
she was a servant, just discharged.</p>

<p>“Well, if you could once see Miss Freylinghausen,
you’d say she was the speaking image of
that person—that maid-servant! I had met Miss
Freylinghausen in New York; and now I have
seen a good bit of her at Saratoga. She is an odd
girl—frank, I should say, and rather blunt in
speech—but not at all the sort of girl that one
could put this question to: ‘Have you ever been a
servant-maid?’ Ha! ha! Ho! ho! and likewise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
He! he! Fancy asking that of one of the Freylinghausens
of Philadelphia!</p>

<p>“Yet, to tell the truth, Beth, that was exactly
what I was tempted to ask. Not particularly because
Miss Freylinghausen looks so much like that
discharged maid I saw at Rivercliff, but because
the Philadelphia heiress has taken up what she
calls a serious work in life. It’s quite the fad, I
believe, nowadays for girls like her to do social
work and the like. She has a hobby, and has interested
the Mater in it, too. At least, I hear that
Miss Freylinghausen is to appear at Hudsonvale
some time this coming winter to prance a little on
her hobby-horse for the delectation of the Hudsonvale
ladies.”</p>
</div>

<p>A good deal more there was in the same strain
in Larry’s sprightly letter; and it was all interesting
to Beth. But this about Miss Freylinghausen
and her resemblance to Cynthia Fogg, was what
impressed Beth the most; for she chanced to remember
now that it was Maude Grimshaw who
had first noticed that resemblance between Cynthia
and the heiress to the Freylinghausen millions.</p>

<p>Beth had not heard from Cynthia since the year
before. That odd girl seemed to have quite
dropped out of her life; yet somehow Beth had a
feeling that they would meet again. Madam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
Hammersly had told Beth once that no holiday
went by but that she received a card or some little
remembrance from Cynthia; but an address was
never added to the strange girl’s signature.</p>

<p>As for Maude Grimshaw, she did not appear at
Rivercliff at the opening of this fall semester. It
was whispered that her marks had been so low the
spring previous that she could not have gone on
with her class without many conditions, and would
have been dropped before Christmas.</p>

<p>So there passed out of Beth’s school life a very
unpleasant and annoying influence. Yet, who was
to say that Maude Grimshaw’s treatment of the
girl from Hudsonvale had not been good discipline
for the latter?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>THE ICE CARNIVAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth</span> entered her senior year in high feather
and with her affairs at full sea. She had saved
more than enough money to pay for her full year’s
tuition. There would be less time during her senior
course to devote to the earning of money; but
what she could accumulate these coming nine
months would go toward the payment of that supposed
loan of four hundred dollars that had
always been a burden on her mind.</p>

<p>Beth had met Mrs. Euphemia Haven once the
preceding summer, and all the time the girl was
in Mrs. Haven’s company, her cheeks burned as
she thought that she was beholden to Larry’s
mother.</p>

<p>“If I ever owe anybody again, or use money
borrowed from anybody, no matter who,” Beth
told Molly, who was her confidant; “it will be because
I am lame in both feet, like Jonathan’s son,
because I have as many boils as Job, and am as
bald as Elijah must have been.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, Beth! don’t say such dreadful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
things,” begged Molly. “And out of the Scriptures,
too. It sounds irreverent.”</p>

<p>Beth’s standing in class naturally gave her a
long lead for the presidency of the seniors. Not
that mere scholarship counts high for that honored
position; but Beth had been steadily growing
in popularity with the students in general of Rivercliff
School, and with her own classmates in particular.</p>

<p>Without Maude Grimshaw to form a cabal
against her, there really was little opposition to
Beth when “J. Molly Granger,” as the jolly one
signed her name to the typewritten notice on the
board, launched her chum’s boom. Laura Hedden,
Izola Pratt, Miss Rice, and several others
who had been Maude’s most faithful “Me toos,”
failed to raise much of a barrier against the rising
flood of Beth’s popularity. Besides, they could
not settle upon an opposing candidate.</p>

<p>Therefore, six weeks after the term opened,
Beth was elected to the class presidency. The senior
class entertained the other older pupils in the
drawing-rooms. There was music, and dancing,
and——</p>

<p>“Real <i>men</i> for partners!” sighed Molly, ecstatically.
“Think of it! We seniors may dance with
the male visitors—if we are asked!”</p>

<p>Beth had a new dress—black and silver. Molly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
said it was “a dream.” And certainly her brunette
chum did look lovely in it. Although Beth
and Mrs. Baldwin had made it themselves, it was
a gown with which any professional dressmaker
might have been satisfied.</p>

<p>There was just one thing missing. Beth had
told Mrs. Baldwin there would be when the frock
was tried on before she left home. Great-grandmother
Lomis’ corals would have given just the
touch needed to make Beth, as Ella declared,
“fairly splendiferous.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Baldwin had not seemed to see it
Beth’s way. The latter felt that she was now old
enough to wear the heirloom. She felt hurt that
her mother did not get it for her; but she contented
herself on the occasion of this first senior
reception, by wearing a band of coral-hued velvet
about her throat. Her dusky shoulders gleamed
exquisitely under the black lace that a wealthy customer
had given her; her silver-figured, short-waisted
gown hung gracefully about her as she
walked. She was all a-sparkle when, just as the
music for the first dance struck up, she appeared
before Miss Hammersly, who, with several of the
teachers, was receiving.</p>

<p>“My dear Beth,” said the principal, tapping
Beth’s bare arm with her fan, “I have a partner
for you. He has been begging the honor and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
cannot refuse—although his name may cause you
an unpleasant thought. But that is all over now,
I hope.”</p>

<p>Beth looked startled for a moment. The very
good looking young man beside the principal was
quite unknown to her.</p>

<p>“Mr. Severn,” said Miss Hammersly, “Miss
Baldwin. Mr. Severn is Mrs. Ricardo Severn’s
nephew.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the nephew who renamed the parrot!”
gasped the blushing Beth.</p>

<p>“Right!” cried the young fellow, his eyes twinkling.
“Really, we, as a family, are insufferably
snobbish. So I determined to save Mr. Montague
from that sin.”</p>

<p>“Dennis Mudd!” laughed Beth. “Dear me!
I think he hated me.”</p>

<p>“He does not love me,” confessed Mr. Severn,
“though I did finish his education.”</p>

<p>“And that foreign person——”</p>

<p>“You mean Saronie, the maid?”</p>

<p>“Yes; she seemed fairly to hate me. I wonder
why?”</p>

<p>“We have much in common,” declared the
young man, “you and I, Miss Baldwin. Saronie
does not fancy me. I think it is because Mrs. Ricardo,
when she shuffles off this mortal coil, will
have much personal property to give away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>Beth found young Mr. Severn a very amusing
person. She danced three times with him, and
then refused him as a partner for the rest of the
evening. “Why, you’re as bad as Mr. Montague,”
she told him. “You want everything and
everybody your own way.”</p>

<p>The reception was an unqualified success, and
Beth was established in the popularity of her class.
Even the wealthiest and dressiest girls had to admit
that “Baldwin shines with the best.”</p>

<p>Beth was destined to see more of Roland Severn.
Usually young men did not ruffle the sheltered
waters of Rivercliff School life. They were
looked upon by Miss Hammersly and the madam
as pirate craft, and were warned off the shoals
quite gallantly by the whole faculty of the school.</p>

<p>But this was the winter that the Nessing River
froze over so solidly that all navigation as high
up as Rivercliff ceased before the first day of December.
There was no snow, and the surface of
the broad stream was like glass. The girls of
Rivercliff School were on the ice every hour they
could spare from their studies.</p>

<p>The bend, between the landing and the point
on this side of the river, was free of ice boats at
all times, for in rounding the point sailing in either
direction, the scooters and larger craft had to
make a wide detour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>This bend proved to be the best stretch of ice
on the river, and Jackson City people came down,
strung colored electric lamps along the shore,
erected booths and shelters, and on moonlight
evenings the scene at the foot of the bluff on which
Rivercliff School stood was a gay one, indeed.</p>

<p>The ice carnival lasted several weeks, and attracted
visitors from far and near. Miss Hammersly
was very careful about allowing the girls,
even the seniors, to go on the ice in the evening;
never allowing more than ten to go together, and
always with one of the teachers for chaperon.</p>

<p>It was on these occasions that Beth met Roland
Severn. Beth always had Molly with her. The
latter began to write her name with the letters
F. W. after it.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake, Molly Granger! what do they
mean?” asked somebody in Beth’s hearing.</p>

<p>“Fifth Wheel,” announced Molly, gravely.</p>

<p>“‘Fifth Wheel?’”</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t you see how much use I am when
we go skating? Mr. Severn looks at me, sometimes,
as though I were something the cat had
brought in.”</p>

<p>But who could have carried tales of Roland Severn’s
attentions to Beth as far as Hudsonvale?
After about a fortnight of this sport at the ice carnival
a tall young man with light hair, a fur cap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
and huge gloves, who could skate almost as well
as the professional teacher who gave exhibitions
each evening after nine o’clock, appeared.</p>

<p>“Larry Haven!” cried Beth, fairly falling into
his arms to save herself from a tumble, she was
so surprised.</p>

<p>Questions and answers volleyed from each.
Larry claimed to have come up to Jackson City
“on a case.” Every one was well. He was going
to stay at a hotel for several days and expected to
have each evening free.</p>

<p>Molly Granger tapped Mr. Severn softly on
the sleeve. “Come away, little Roland,” she whispered.
“That is a sure-enough lawyer-man who
used to pull Beth to school on his sled. You and
I are still school children. Come away from
here—and I will weep with you.”</p>

<p>Beth bore Larry off to Miss Carroll, who
chanced to be with the party on this evening; and
the young lawyer came to Rivercliff School by appointment,
was welcomed by the madam, who
graciously remembered him, and was introduced
to Miss Hammersly herself.</p>

<p>Larry remained much in evidence until the
school broke up for the Christmas and New Year
holidays. But it cannot be said that Beth bestowed
any great amount of attention upon him, after all.
The other girls pronounced him “just dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>Beth was in training for the skating races that
the skating committee, with the help of Miss
Crossleigh, of the school had arranged for. Skating
had always been popular at Rivercliff; and now
that it had gained such general approval there was
not much else talked about outside of study hours
and the classroom.</p>

<p>Beth, in her first winter at Rivercliff, had shown
her superiority in skating over many of her classmates;
but now she had a number of rivals. Both
the long distance and short distance races were
going to be hotly contested. As for the exhibitions
of fancy skating, Beth did not participate in them
at all. She saved her strength, skill and wind for
the real work on the races.</p>

<p>Miss Hammersly lent her support to the affair,
as she did to everything in the way of athletics
that was of physical benefit to her girls.</p>

<p>The races were at night, for it was then that
there could be the most brilliant display upon the
ice. A thousand electric lamps, the power supplied
from the trolley company’s plant up the
river, aided a cold and brilliant December moon
in illuminating the icefield that night.</p>

<p>Other races had been held before, and hockey
games and other sports; but nothing previously
arranged drew so great a crowd as the Rivercliff
School ice sports. The school was the most popular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
establishment in that part of the State, and the
largest. The sports drew the friends of the school
for many miles around, as well as hundreds from
Jackson City, and practically all of the hamlet
at Rivercliff landing that could get to the riverside
without the aid of crutches.</p>

<p>Larry had remained for this event. Indeed, it
being but two days to the closing of the term, he
had planned a surprise for Beth—and that surprise
had been confided only to Miss Hammersly,
for her permission had to be obtained.</p>

<p>First came the races, however; and that glorious
night would long be remembered in the annals of
Rivercliff School. “It will be sung in song and
story,” Molly Granger proclaimed, afterward.</p>

<p>“How can it be ‘sung in story,’ Granger?” demanded
one carping critic.</p>

<p>“In recitative,” responded Molly, quickly.</p>

<p>Molly herself was a contestant in several of the
events of the evening. She was not a very rapid
skater; but she was sure on her skates, and she
had learned many fancy strokes. One of her best
feats was when she and Stella Price waltzed very
prettily together on the ice.</p>

<p>It was the fifty and the one hundred yard
dashes, and the two-mile race around a measured
oval on the ice, that held the deepest attention
of the throng that had come to view these trials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
of speed. The dashes were from a flying start,
of course. In the fifty yard Beth was second; in
the hundred yard she was first—by a good lead.
Later, when the contestants for the two-mile race
were started, she was one of the favorites.</p>

<p>There were twenty starters, and they were all
good skaters. The little, dark, ugly girl, Laura
Hedden, who had been such a friend of Maude
Grimshaw, was next to Beth in the line.</p>

<p>Spitefulness breeds spitefulness. Laura could
not have told why she “hated that Baldwin girl;”
but she had been so well taught by the absent
Maude that she considered Beth her particular
enemy now.</p>

<p>As they got off, Laura’s left skate clashed
with Beth’s right. Both girls might have been
thrown; but Beth recovered herself instantly on
the other foot and darted off—only a stroke behind
the best of the starters. Laura began to
shriek:</p>

<p>“Foul! Foul! Baldwin fouled me! ’Tisn’t
fair!”</p>

<p>As it chanced, Miss Crossleigh and one of the
official starters had seen the accident.</p>

<p>“You are the one who fouled, Miss Hedden,”
said the instructor, tartly. “You may race or not
as you please. I do not think it was intentional on
your part.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>But Laura had wasted so much time calling
aloud that she was injured, it was useless for her
to attempt the race. Most of the skaters were
already half a lap away. But Laura found friends
among the other girls and some in the crowd of
spectators, to hold up her contention that she had
been fouled by Beth Baldwin.</p>

<p>Luckily, Beth knew nothing about this at the
time. In her short, close-fitting sweater and cap,
with her scant skirt, her gloved hands clenched,
she had shot away in the immediate wake of the
other girls, scarcely noticing her clash of skates
with Laura.</p>

<p>At the far turn on the first lap she “crossed the
bows” of several of the other contestants, and took
the inside of the course. She knew enough about
fancy skating to take short turns without faltering,
and in such a brief race as two miles she believed
the struggle would be close all the way.</p>

<p>And it was. At the second turn (it was two
laps to the mile), Beth was among the leaders—seven
of the best skaters in the school. Every girl
tried to do her best.</p>

<p>The end of the first mile saw Beth and Miss
Rice elbow to elbow. There were others near;
but the race was really between these two from
this point to the end.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p268.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">THERE WAS A WHITE LINE BEFORE HER! IT WAS THE TAPE.<br>

<span class="illoright">Page <a href="#Page_269">269</a>.</span></p>

<p>Sometimes Beth would forge a foot or two
ahead; sometimes Miss Rice would make a spurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>It was grilling work. Beth could not shake off
her rival and began to feel her own strength waning.
She had to arouse all her energy and determination
when she came into the home stretch, the
last half lap of the two miles, for she was well
spent.</p>

<p>The cheering and encouragement came to her
ears faintly. Luckily, she could not hear what
Laura Hedden and her supporters were saying.</p>

<p>It seemed to Beth as though all her strength had
gone—as though her limbs below her knees were
merely wooden props which she could barely push
on.</p>

<p>She lost sight of the crowd; and the lights
around the course, which were strung on iron
pikes driven into the ice, seemed to stand still.
She heard heavy breathing—seemingly at her very
ear. Was it Rice? Or was another contestant
overtaking her?</p>

<p>Then she realized that it was her own breathing
she heard. Her lungs were pumping savagely.
Only a well-trained body, untrammeled by improper
dress, could have stood that strain.</p>

<p>There was a white line before her! It was the
tape.</p>

<p>Where was Rice? Where——</p>

<p>She dashed against the tape, and the next moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
Molly and Miss Crossleigh caught her. Miss
Rice was six yards behind!</p>

<p>“One of the fastest two miles ever skated on
this river, bar none, Miss Baldwin,” the official
scorer, the sporting editor of the Jackson City
<i>Daily Mail</i>, announced. “That last half lap you
made was a wonder.”</p>

<p>But Beth’s abundant success could not completely
smother the objections of the small part of
the school that was opposed to her. It was not
the last spiteful exhibition of prejudice against
Beth that ever raised its head at Rivercliff.</p>

<p>Now that she was breathing easily again and
the pulse had stopped pounding in her ears, Beth
could hear something besides applause. The congratulations
of her friends did not entirely quench
the criticisms of those who sided with Laura
Hedden.</p>

<p>The latter was furious. The fact that Miss
Crossleigh would pay no attention to her announcement
of unjust treatment urged the stubborn
and ill-natured girl to claim still greater
injury than she had in the first place. Indeed, the
grievance that she herself had manufactured
against Beth had grown to mountainous proportions.</p>

<p>All the way up to the school, after the carnival
broke up, Beth heard hints and innuendoes regarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
the unfairness shown in the conduct of the
two-mile race. At first she did not understand
it; she only realized that, despite her high standing
in her class and with most of the girls and the
teachers, there were still those who considered
her little less than the “forward pauper” that
Maude Grimshaw had once called her.</p>

<p>Although Maude had left Rivercliff, her spirit
had not been quenched among certain of the older
girls. “The ill men do lives after them,” is a
trite and true saying. The bad influence Miss
Grimshaw had gained over her “Me toos” still
existed, and hatred of Beth was fostered by Laura
Hedden and girls of her type.</p>

<p>In this incident of the race the little, dark,
unpleasant girl had a personal reason for being
angry with Beth. She was really a very good
skater; and had she not stopped at the beginning
of the race to wrangle over the “foul,” she would
have stood just as good a chance of winning as
Beth.</p>

<p>“But who could win <i>anything</i> at this school
when all the teachers are prejudiced in the favor
of just one person?” Laura demanded loudly, as
the crowd climbed the hilly street to the school.</p>

<p>“You are quite right, Laura,” agreed another
girl, who thought she had some cause for enmity
to the president of the senior class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“Oh, you can’t beat that Beth Baldwin!”
laughed a third, nastily. “What do you say, Rice?
Was that race fairly won?”</p>

<p>Miss Rice thought she had reason for disliking
Beth, too. It dated back to the time when she
had so hurt and insulted the girl from Hudsonvale
by refusing to trust her handkerchiefs in
Beth’s possession. Of course, when one has ill-treated
another, unless one acknowledges his fault,
the ill-feeling remains. Miss Rice had never
owned up to her wrong attitude toward Beth.</p>

<p>And now that she had been beaten by her in
this very close race, she was thoroughly disappointed
and angry.</p>

<p>“You can’t expect Miss Crossleigh to be fair
when Miss Hammersly’s pet is involved, can
you?” scoffed Miss Rice. “Twice Beth Baldwin
skated right in front of me. It would have been
called a foul on the part of any other contestant.”</p>

<p>Beth, who was within earshot, said nothing.
She was thankful that Larry and the other boys
had not been allowed to walk up from the ice with
the Rivercliff girls.</p>

<p>Miss Crossleigh and the other teachers were
well out of hearing, but Molly Granger was at
hand.</p>

<p>“Cracky-me!” she blurted out. “What ever are
you talking about, Rice? Don’t you know that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
every knock is a boost? You were beaten fairly
enough, and you’ll only make yourself the laughing
stock of the whole school if you say such
things. Of course Beth skated in front of you.
Especially at the end of the race.”</p>

<p>This caused some of the other girls to laugh;
and, naturally, the “knockers” were not pleased.</p>

<p>“No matter what Beth Baldwin did, Molly
Granger, <i>you’d</i> back her up,” said Laura Hedden,
spitefully.</p>

<p>“You bet I would!” cried the slangy Molly.
“I’m one good little backer, <i>I</i> am! I’d back up
Nero if I heard <i>you</i> running him down. I’d know
for sure that there had been a mistake made in
history.”</p>

<p>“‘R-r-rebecca! don’dt fight!’” sing-songed
Mamie Dunn, through her nose. “You’re as bad
as the rest of them, Molly. Let it drop.”</p>

<p>But Laura Hedden and her personal friends,
as well as Miss Rice and her chums, had no intention
of giving up their point of view.</p>

<p>There was a well-defined “party of the opposition”
to the senior class president and to her supporters,
organized during these few final days of
the term. Beth Baldwin went home with the feeling
that on her return she would have to face the
active enmity of a not inconsiderable number of
her classmates.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

<small>MISS FREYLINGHAUSEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Larry’s</span> surprise included a novel way for Beth
and a dozen of her girl friends to get home for the
holidays. These girls, besides Beth and Molly,
lived in the river towns strung along the Nessing
between the school and Hudsonvale. Larry secured
a huge sleigh in Jackson City and a team of
well sharpened horses with a sober driver to take
them down the river on the ice. Miss Hammersly
approved of the party starting early in the morning
so as to make Hudsonvale before night.</p>

<p>The girls could drop off at their several home
towns, while Molly would remain over night with
Beth and go on to Hambro—and the seven aunts—the
next day. Larry was to sit on the driver’s
seat and act as courier for the party.</p>

<p>It was an exciting and novel ride, and all the
girls pronounced it a lovely adventure. They
thanked Beth as their hostess, for all seemed to
take it for granted that had it not been for Beth,
Larry Haven would not have done such a thing.</p>

<p>There was a crowd to see them off when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
the sleigh slid down upon the ice, and in it Molly
saw Mr. Roland Severn. She beckoned to him
to come close, and whispered:</p>

<p>“Grieve not, brave youth! There are other fish
in the sea quite as good as those already hooked.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Granger. I am quite sure of
it,” he returned, with gravity. “I shall be in Hambro
before New Year. May I call?”</p>

<p>“Cracky-me!” Molly was startled into exclaiming.
“I wasn’t looking upon myself in the light of
a fish, nor do I wish to be so considered.”</p>

<p>But she had to admit to Beth that Mr. Severn
was quick at repartee. “It isn’t often that anybody
gets the best of lil’ Molly. I wonder if I
could draw a portrait of him—as a cat, of course—or
perhaps a fish!”</p>

<p>It was a gay and busy holiday time for Beth.
The family seemed particularly glad to see her.
And Beth found a new spirit of hopefulness in the
little cottage.</p>

<p>Marcus had been taking a business course at an
evening school for some time. Young as he was,
he had been advanced by his employer to the typewriter
and was drawing eight dollars a week. Mr.
Baldwin seemed very cheerful, too, and Beth
thought he seemed a hundred per cent. better.</p>

<p>Larry and she had been acting the part of very
good friends for nearly a fortnight; but for two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
days after her return home Beth did not see the
young lawyer at all.</p>

<p>“Was he going to withdraw into his shell
again?” she queried. She scarcely knew what to
make of Larry in some of his moods; and she was
old enough now to resent such conduct.</p>

<p>But on the third evening Larry appeared at the
Bemis Street cottage, and evidently in high spirits.
He brought from his mother a particular and written
invitation for Beth to be present at an evening
function at Mrs. Haven’s, scheduled to occur in
the week between Christmas and New Year.</p>

<p>“You ought, really, to have a new dress,” Mrs.
Baldwin said, all of a flutter. “Euphemia always
has such nice people at her evening parties.”</p>

<p>“Tempt me not!” laughed Beth. “I have been
hobnobbing with the rich so long, that Mrs. Haven’s
dressiest affairs have no terrors for me. Besides,
I can’t afford it. Moreover, the black lace
and silver is new here in Hudsonvale.”</p>

<p>“Likewise,” said Ella, with her head on one side
like a saucy sparrow, “Larry has never seen her
in that.”</p>

<p>Beth drove her out of the room then; but it was
for another reason. She asked, frankly: “Mamma
Baldwin, don’t you think I am old enough now to
wear Great-grandmother Lomis’ corals?”</p>

<p>Her mother fairly gasped. She sat down suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
and looked up into her eldest daughter’s
face with almost a pleading expression in her
own.</p>

<p>“My dear Beth!” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Mother dear! what is the matter?” demanded
the girl, a little frightened by her mother’s air.</p>

<p>“I—I shrink from telling you. Those beautiful
corals! Been in the family so long! And you
had been led to expect them!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baldwin was actually sobbing. Her
daughter put both arms around her and hugged
her close.</p>

<p>“There, there, dear! Never mind! If you
don’t want me to wear them——”</p>

<p>“But I’d be glad to have you wear them,
if——”</p>

<p>“If what?”</p>

<p>“If they were yours to wear!”</p>

<p>“What—what do you mean?” stammered Beth.</p>

<p>“They had to be sold, my child! I had to sell
the heirloom that had been so long in our family.
You will never be able to wear the corals again,
dear Beth.”</p>

<p>Beth actually swallowed something that seemed
to choke her. “Oh, my dear!” she said. “I might
have known you poor folks at home were having
a worse time than you let selfish me know.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Beth!” cried Mrs. Baldwin. “They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
were sold before your father left the Works.
They were sold to pay your first year’s tuition!”</p>

<p>“<i>What?</i>” almost shouted Beth.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear. Forgive me——”</p>

<p>“Forgive you?” cried the deliriously happy
Beth, trying to dance her mother about the room.
“Why, darling little Mumsy! you have freed my
heart of a great burden of woe! I’m glad to go
to Mrs. Haven’s party to-night——”</p>

<p>“What are you saying, child?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well! I can look everybody straight in
the eye and tell each and every one—— Well!
never mind! I am happy—<i>so</i> happy!”</p>

<p>“But, my dear child! Are you crazy? Your
Great-grandmother’s corals——”</p>

<p>“Goodness me, Mother mine!” interposed Beth.
“What do you suppose I care about the old corals—really?
This that you tell me lifts a load
off my mind. Then you didn’t borrow money to
send me to Rivercliff?”</p>

<p>“No-o.”</p>

<p>“And the four hundred dollars hasn’t got to be
paid back?”</p>

<p>“No-o.”</p>

<p>“Well then! why not happiness instead of woebegoneness?”
cried the girl. “I am delighted.
Only, Mother mine, I wish you had told me this
long, long ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“Why—dear——”</p>

<p>“I should have felt so much happier,” declared
Beth. “So very much happier.”</p>

<p>Another thing happened that day besides Mrs.
Euphemia Haven’s reception. Beth received a
letter from Madam Hammersly. The madam
wrote rather a queer letter, containing this important
question:</p>

<p>“Is Cynthia Fogg with you in your town? I
have received from her a Christmas present—expressed
direct from Hudsonvale—a very beautiful
<i>lavaliere</i> that could not have cost less than ten
pounds.” Madam Hammersly steadfastly refused
to think in anything but English money.</p>

<p>It was plain to be seen that Madam Hammersly
feared her one-time parlor-maid had become possessed
of the valuable trinket dishonestly.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose that can mean?” Beth
asked her mother; but, of course, Mrs. Baldwin
was quite as ignorant as Beth herself of the whereabouts
of Cynthia Fogg.</p>

<p>Beth wondered if she ought to make a house-to-house
canvass of Hudsonvale for the elusive Cynthia.
And if the girl was in the village, why had
she not been to the cottage on Bemis Street? Cynthia
knew Beth’s address.</p>

<p>Beth went to the Haven house that evening with
several interesting matters in her busy mind—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
she went again in a taxicab. Marcus paid for it
out of his own pocket. He rode along with her,
“so as to get his money’s worth,” he said.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Beth was rather disappointed
when she found it was not merely an evening dance—for
she “adored balls,” so she said. The larger
dancing floor at Mrs. Haven’s was littered with
chairs and benches, and, at first, when the guests
came down from the dressing rooms, they were
officiously herded into the rows of seats by ushers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Haven addressed her guests in her very
best platform style. Larry’s mother was president
of two clubs, vice-president of another, and principal
speaker at most of their meetings. So she
had pat the public speaker’s manner.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have brought you together this evening, dear
friends, to be first entertained in a rather novel
way. Afterward we shall have dancing. I met not
long ago a very bright young lady from Philadelphia,
who interested me very much in a subject now
coming largely before the public, and I felt the
wish to have her come here to talk to us of Hudsonvale,
who may be helped by her experience.</p>

<p>“The question of domestic service has of late
years become of grave importance. This brave
young lady—whose name you will all recognize,
and whose social position you all know—had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
temerity to go forth and gain information at first
hand regarding the real conditions of such service,
and of the characters of the girls who enter into
domestic service. I take great pleasure in introducing
to you, ladies and gentlemen, Miss C. Emeline
Freylinghausen, of Philadelphia, my guest for
the holidays.”</p>

</div>

<p>A lithe girl, in a perfect evening gown, her hair
piled high on her head, a plentiful sprinkle of
freckles across the bridge of her nose, and wonderfully
compelling blue eyes, stepped forward
and bowed. When she began to speak it was a
pleasure to listen to her—whether or not one believed
in her theories or cared about her subject.</p>

<p>Beth was seated far from the speaker and to
one side. Was it——? Could it be——?</p>

<p>Beth heard the speaker’s tongue arraign mistresses
who ill-treated their servants or were careless
of their comfort. Her biting sarcasm was
just what one would expect from Cynthia Fogg’s
lips.</p>

<p>But, Miss Freylinghausen, of Philadelphia, the
heiress to millions, to houses and lands; and Cynthia
Fogg, of whose green hat with the purple
feather which Molly had knocked overboard from
the <i>Water Wagtail</i>, Beth still retained a very vivid
memory——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>“Why, it is impossible!” gasped Beth, aloud,
and forgot to applaud when the little, earnest talk
was over. She sat in her seat, unable to rise, or
even think connectedly, when the talk had ended.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the charming figure came down from
the dais and seized Beth in her arms.</p>

<p>“Well, Chicken Little! who told you the sky
had fallen?” demanded Miss C. Emeline Freylinghausen,
shaking Beth, playfully.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>THE “PERFECT NUMBER” IN AUNTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth</span> had something really wonderful to tell
Molly Granger when the winter vacation was over
and she met that young lady on the train bound
for Rivercliff School.</p>

<p>And Molly listened in as rapt amazement as
Beth had experienced when she listened to the public
talk of “Miss Cynthia Emeline Fogg Freylinghausen,”
as Molly ever after insisted upon calling
their mysterious friend.</p>

<p>“And cracky-me!” giggled Molly. “If only
Maude Grimshaw could know this! She was such
a close personal friend of the heiress of the Freylinghausen
millions. Oh, my aunt! as Cynthia herself
would say. In my case—oh, my seven aunts!
And Bethesda! They are all coming to our graduation.”</p>

<p>“Who are?” demanded the surprised, not to say
startled, Beth. Molly did jump about so from one
subject to another.</p>

<p>“My aunts. They have promised. Yea, verily,
they have threatened. Do you suppose, if I tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
Miss Hammersly they are coming, that she will
feel it necessary to limit us all to fewer friends on
graduation day?”</p>

<p>But that fondly-looked-forward-to day still
seemed a long, long way ahead to Beth and her
class at Rivercliff School. First, much chatter and
wonder had to be expressed over the discovery
that Cynthia Fogg was a “millionairess”—Molly’s
designation, of course.</p>

<p>Madam Hammersly was really the most
amazed person who ever wore a cap. She exclaimed
to Beth once:</p>

<p>“Miss Baldwin, to think of my scolding that
young lady so—and actually discharging her for
incompetence!”</p>

<p>“But she was incompetent, wasn’t she?” laughed
Beth. “Whatever Cynthia learned about the
theory of domestic service, she certainly did not
learn much about the actual practice thereof.”</p>

<p>“But—Miss Freylinghausen!” murmured the
good lady, who had all the middle-class Englishwoman’s
awe for riches and position.</p>

<p>Cynthia, at Mrs. Haven’s party, had been quite
confidential with Beth. The latter learned that
Cynthia had by no means started out with the intention
of informing herself concerning the theory
of domestic service. She was merely an idle, disappointed,
rich girl, disgusted with her life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>She had actually run away from home—not
from an institution—when the chums met her on
the <i>Water Wagtail</i>. She was not then of age, and
she had a guardian who had insisted on her going
to Europe with his wife and daughters. It was
he whom Cynthia (as Beth and Molly continued
to call her) feared would follow her.</p>

<p>To hide her escapade the guardian announced
that she had gone to Europe. Meanwhile, Cynthia
was bothering the good madam at Rivercliff
School.</p>

<p>“The dear thing!” she told Beth. “I shall always
love and pity her, for I did make her so much
trouble!”</p>

<p>“But my dear Miss Freylinghausen!” gasped
Mrs. Haven, who was listening frankly to all this.
“You do not mean to say that you were at that
school with Beth?”</p>

<p>“Not in the literary department—in the domestic
department,” laughed Cynthia. “Beth was
really instrumental in getting me the job. And at
that I could not keep it. I couldn’t suit Madam
Hammersly—and I really tried, too. But Beth
suited her. Beth showed herself to be the ‘better
man of us two.’”</p>

<p>Miss Freylinghausen’s evident liking for Beth—her
admiration for her, in fact—made its impression
upon Mrs. Haven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>That lady’s eyes were often fixed upon the brilliant
beauty of her old friend’s daughter during
the remainder of the evening—and with a new expression
in her own countenance.</p>

<p>But all this was “ancient history” now. Back
at Rivercliff, Beth Baldwin had altogether too
much of really vital importance to think of to be
bothered by reflections upon either Larry’s mother
or Larry himself.</p>

<p>As she had feared, the girl from Hudsonvale
returned to school to face pronounced opposition
in her own class. It did not so much matter about
the dislike expressed by girls in the lower grades;
but it was in the power of Laura Hedden, Miss
Rice, and a few others of the seniors, to make
Beth’s existence very unhappy indeed.</p>

<p>And the worst of it was, it did not seem to be
a situation that Beth could control. She could
not take affairs into her own hands, as she had
on that long past occasion of the Red Masque.
She could not withdraw herself now from the remainder
of her class. Being its president, and a
leader in all its activities, it would have been beneath
her even to notice many of the slights and
insults aimed at her. The sting of them was quite
as sharp, however. This situation was harder
to endure than any of Maude Grimshaw’s old-time
persecutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>At every business meeting of the senior class
(and these became frequent as time went on), the
schism against Beth was shown to be stronger. It
did not do for her to propose the simplest thing;
at once some girl jumped up with an objection or
a counter-proposal.</p>

<p>“Why,” said the usually jolly Molly, quite seriously
now, “I believe if we had to discuss right
now whether ‘two and two make four,’ Hedden
or Rice or somebody, would jump up and claim it
didn’t. What’s the matter with you all, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re not going to have everything all
your own way, Molly Granger, so there!” said one
of the obstructionists.</p>

<p>“No,” said another. “Too many things have
been cut and dried for us. <i>We</i> want to have something
to say about what the senior class does.”</p>

<p>“Who’s we?” demanded Molly, warmly.</p>

<p>“Point of order!” drawled one girl. “Has
Miss Granger been called to the chair, <i>pro tem</i>?”</p>

<p>Beth began heartily to wish that Molly was
chairman at these disorderly meetings—or somebody
besides herself. When the opposition could
not gain its point, very often the quarrelsome girls
were so noisy that the session adjourned without
having accomplished the object for which it had
been called.</p>

<p>Of course, her inability to control the meetings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
counted against Beth. Reports of them circulated
through the school and quickly reached the
ears of the teachers. Miss Hammersly would be
the last to know about the friction in the senior
class; but she must know in time, and she would
then call the class president to account.</p>

<p>Long as the time seemed to June, the days
passed only too swiftly. The senior class of Rivercliff
considered itself, of course, quite a wonderful
body of young ladies. And Miss Hammersly
did all in her power to inspire them with the belief
that the whole world lay open before them to be
conquered.</p>

<p>Beth kept busily at work with both her books
and her needle. She was piling up quite a little
sum of money—there was a new object in view.</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin was doing very well with one of
his inventions, and a second one promised to make
both him and Larry Haven moderately wealthy.
The family was not likely to need her financial aid
after all. When she began to teach, her salary
would be her own.</p>

<p>And now that she had so much money saved,
Beth wished to try to recover Great-grandmother
Lomis’ corals. She had learned from her mother
who had the heirloom; she was sure Mrs. Haven
never wore the corals; she desired very much to
buy them back from Larry’s mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>For, after all, Beth was a real girl and loved
jewelry and the like just as much as any other
girl.</p>

<p>This hope, however, was not the first thought in
her mind. She neglected none of her senior class
tasks for the sake of earning more money. She
had even passed a good deal of her work over to
another girl in a lower class, who needed to help
herself through school. The doctrine of independence
was beginning to be established at Rivercliff
School in spite of such girls as Laura Hedden.</p>

<p>Social affairs were always of more importance
to the senior class than to any of the other girls.
The members of the senior class being really the
hostesses at the monthly “hop,” considerable time
and thought had to be given by the social committee
to these occasions.</p>

<p>Beth, as class president, was chairman of this
social committee; but she saw so much opposition
arrayed against her that she feared the good times
of the other girls would be spoiled if she did not
withdraw. Her act in doing this—with the excuse
that she was too busy to fulfil the duties attached
to the chairmanship—did not please either
her own friends or the opposition.</p>

<p>“Say! what do you do that for?” Molly
Granger demanded. “Want to ‘crab the film?’
We need you to suggest ideas—and carry ’em out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
too. Now, you just see! The hop this week will
be a fizzle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, be an optimist, honey,” Beth said, laughing.
“Look on the bright side.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I know how to be an optimist,”
Molly returned, though still resentfully.
“It’s like the old fellow with the two teeth.”</p>

<p>“Who was he?” asked her chum.</p>

<p>“Why, this poor old chap could only eat the
plainest kind of food, and couldn’t read anything,
or play anything, or make anything. Just the
same he seemed pretty cheerful and thought this
world a pretty fine place to live in.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ he said, ‘I’m goin’ on eighty-two. I’ve
been bald-headed thirty years, a widower for
twenty-five, had indigestion nearly all my life, can’t
hear unless folks holler at me, can’t see to read,
ain’t reliable on my feet any more, and I’ve only
got two teeth left—but, thank God, they hit!’</p>

<p>“That’s an optimist,” concluded jolly Molly.
“But there’s nothing very optimistic in the outlook
for our evening parties if you back out,
Bethesda. I can’t see what you are thinking of.”</p>

<p>Beth dared not tell her chum just what she
really was thinking of. It seemed to Beth Baldwin
that the only way to stop friction in the senior
class was for her to resign as class president.</p>

<p>Larry Haven seemed to have considerable business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
to see to for his clients at Jackson City or in
the vicinity that spring. And he came frequently
to Rivercliff to call. On the other hand, Mr. Roland
Severn was quite a favorite with Miss
Granger. One or the other, sometimes both, were
at the senior receptions all those last months of
Beth and Molly’s stay at Rivercliff.</p>

<p>On the very evening to which Molly looked
forward so apprehensively, both Larry and Roland
Severn appeared as guests of the senior class.
Beth had considered retiring to Number Eighty
after supper and not coming down for the party
at all; but she was glad she had not done this
when she saw the boys. Larry would have been
sure to make inquiries and that would have called
attention to the trouble in the senior class.</p>

<p>That the opposition to Beth as president was
really increasing, was plain to all the observant
girls. If Beth chanced to pass certain groups the
laughter and chatter ceased instantly. At other
times scornful glances and sharp speeches were
flung at the class president.</p>

<p>With two such gallants as Larry and Roland
(for both hovered about Beth and Molly), neither
of the girl chums could feel neglected. Indeed,
jolly Molly would not have been neglected in any
case, for she was popular with almost everybody,
despite her partizanship in Beth’s cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>If there were any boys at these parties at all,
they were sure to give Molly Granger plenty of
attention. Her tongue was the smartest of all
her class—and she could say funny and bright
things without putting any sting into them.</p>

<p>Some of the other seniors were popular with
the visitors, too; but not all. Miss Rice, for instance,
although one of the best dressed girls in
the school, was almost sure to be a wallflower.
She danced now and then with some other girl;
the remainder of the time she either sat alone, or
joined some equally neglected group.</p>

<p>That is, unless Larry Haven or Roland Severn
asked for the honor of being her partner. Always,
if they were present, these young men each
danced with Miss Rice at least once. There were,
likewise, other wallflowers with whom these two
danced.</p>

<p>Though a good skater, Miss Rice was not a
good dancer. And she possessed no flow of small
talk and few of the graces that are supposed to
attract young men. Besides, she was downright
homely.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Miss Rice had a bright mind—too
bright to believe, for a moment, that her own
personal attractions caused the two young men to
put themselves out solely for her pleasure.</p>

<p>Of course, as Miss Hammersly would not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
allowed any of her girls to dance continually with
the same partners, Larry and Roland could not
hover about Beth and Molly all the evening. But
they could easily have found more attractive girls
than the ones they often selected when Beth and
Molly were dancing with other partners.</p>

<p>On this particular evening Miss Rice retired to
Madam Hammersly’s room to repair a small tear
in the lace of her skirt. The door was not closed;
but there was a heavy portière between the room
and the hall and anybody outside would not have
guessed the girl’s nearness.</p>

<p>“Well, Severn, old boy, have you done your
duty among the ‘overlooked ladies’ this evening?”
asked a masculine voice.</p>

<p>“I should hope so,” was Roland’s reply. “And
twice with Miss Rice.”</p>

<p>“You’ve nothing on me there,” said Larry
Haven. “I shouldn’t want to displease Beth, but
sometimes it’s a bore to dance with these wallflowers.”</p>

<p>“Now you’ve said it!” young Severn agreed,
with feeling.</p>

<p>“But Beth says I can’t come at all to these ‘shindigs’
if I don’t help give the unpopular girls a good
time. And she picks the ones I must dance with,
too,” and Larry chuckled rather ruefully.</p>

<p>“She said as much to me,” Roland Severn acknowledged.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
“She’s an awfully thoughtful, kind-hearted
girl.”</p>

<p>“She’s a dear,” agreed Larry, warmly. “Beth
was always just the best ever. Thinks about others
more than she does of herself.”</p>

<p>The two young men walked away. Miss Rice
remained in the semi-darkness of the madam’s
room for some time—long enough to feel that her
cheeks were cool again and that the tears were
gone from her eyes.</p>

<p>The thoughtless words of the two careless
young men served an unexpected purpose. For
once good grew from evil—sweet from the bitter.
Ill-tempered as Miss Rice had shown herself to
be, she was not shallow like Laura Hedden and
some of the others who were opposed to Beth
Baldwin in school affairs.</p>

<p>She saw at once that Beth, without suspecting
that Miss Rice or the other wallflowers would ever
know about it, had used her influence with the two
most popular young men attending the school
dances to insure the neglected members of the senior
class the pleasure of having male partners.</p>

<p>Of course, as a member of the social committee,
it had been Beth’s duty to see that all were made
happy if possible; but Miss Rice well knew that
it was something besides duty that had suggested
to the class president this particular way of aiding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
in the pleasure of the social occasion for all in the
senior class.</p>

<p>To girls in general, and of the age of Beth’s
classmates, the attentions of young men are as
pleasing and satisfactory as anything in life. It
gives even an awkward girl more confidence in herself
to be singled out as a dancing partner by
young men.</p>

<p>The chums, however, really had little time for
“boys,” as Molly scoffingly called them. “Too
much to do. And seven aunts to see me duck from
under the scholastic yoke,” added the jolly one.</p>

<p>Miss Rice’s discovery, made as she mended her
torn lace in the madam’s room, bore fruit. She
was really a serious-minded girl.</p>

<p>She could recall now many thoughtful and helpful
things Beth Baldwin had proposed for the
good of the senior class. Many of these suggestions
Miss Rice, herself, and the Laura Hedden
crowd had opposed with both vigor and venom.</p>

<p>In fully a dozen cases the awakened girl had to
admit that Beth Baldwin’s plans had proved wise.
Her withdrawal now from the chairmanship of
the social committee was likely to be a real catastrophe.</p>

<p>After all, Miss Rice was loyal to Rivercliff; and
she believed that others of the obstructionists
were, too. Was their opposition to the will of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
majority of the senior class—and especially to
Beth Baldwin—going to be of any good in the
end?</p>

<p>“Even if we make her resign the presidency,”
she told some of her confidants the day following
the evening party, “it will create a terrible row.
And Miss Hammersly will be just as hurt as she
can be.”</p>

<p>“Let her be!” snapped one of Laura Hedden’s
particular friends. “What business has she to let
a pauper come to Rivercliff, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Now, that’s all nonsense, and we know it,”
said Miss Rice, boldly. “In the first place, it’s
been awfully handy to have a girl like Beth Baldwin
here to do mending and sewing and the like,
for us lazy ones. I don’t like the girl, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Then what are you fussing about her for?”
demanded another of the party.</p>

<p>“Because I see we’re fighting the best interests
of the class and the school. And for another
thing,” added Miss Rice, turning a fiery red.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” was the general cry.</p>

<p>“Well—just because Beth Baldwin is a whole
lot more decent and forgiving than I would ever
be if I were in her place,” blurted out Miss Rice.
“What do you think?”</p>

<p>Heatedly and baldly, she told of the discovery
she had made the evening before. It was not an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
easy thing for a girl to confess—that she was unattractive,
a veritable wallflower. And some of
these very girls she talked to were in that same
class. But having spurred her courage up, Miss
Rice went through with her confession.</p>

<p>“And that’s the sort of girl Baldwin is,” she
concluded, rather breathlessly. “I know I
shouldn’t have done it. I’m pretty sure there isn’t
a girl here who would have so secretly heaped
coals of fire on her enemy’s head.</p>

<p>“Come, now! let us be honest—let us be fair.
I don’t like poverty-stricken girls, or girls who
come to Rivercliff as Beth Baldwin did, any better
than heretofore. But she has beaten me. I
don’t mean only in that skating race. She has
beaten me in <i>being decent</i>!</p>

<p>“I admit that Miss Hammersly seems to favor
her, and the teachers are always boosting Baldwin.
But I guess there is good reason for their
doing so. I have been acting the dog-in-the-manger
part. Never again; I’m going to bury the
hatchet right here and now.”</p>

<p>“Bury the hammer, I guess you mean, Rice,”
giggled one of her hearers, nervously.</p>

<p>“All right. I’m going to stop knocking. Just
as sure as you live, as Molly Granger says, ‘every
knock is a boost.’ We might as well stop fighting
Beth Baldwin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>Of course, they did not all agree with the girl
whose conscience had been awakened. Laura
Hedden was by no means of the same type as Miss
Rice. Laura managed to hold some of the opposition
together.</p>

<p>But before the month rolled around and the
date of another of the school parties approached,
a paper was circulated in the senior class for signatures,
asking Beth Baldwin to reconsider her
resignation from the chairmanship of the social
committee. The first signature on the paper was
that of Miss Rice, followed by the names of several
of the former “party of the opposition.”</p>

<p>“So, ‘all’s well that ends well,’” quoted jolly
Molly Granger, happily. “You’ve just <i>got</i> to get
back into harness, Bethesda. The ranks of the
enemy are broken. It just proves what I’ve always
said, my dear: You are the most popular girl
who ever came to school here at Rivercliff.”</p>

<p>“I wonder!” murmured Beth.</p>

<p>“You wonder what?” questioned her chum.</p>

<p>“I wonder how Rice came to change so.”</p>

<p>But unless Beth Baldwin chances to read this
narrative of Rivercliff School, she is likely never
to be enlightened regarding this particular mystery.
And at this time there was so much else of
moment going on that she had little leisure to give
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>The days were being counted at last. Such a
fluttering in the dove-cote as graduation drew
nigh! Dresses to try on, last examinations to
take, trips to the milliner and shoe stores, theses
to write, conditions to make up, letters to write to
friends and relatives, enclosing tickets to the formal
exercises and invitations to the various receptions
and teas.</p>

<p>“Seven tickets to Hambro,” groaned Molly. “I
tried to get Miss Hammersly to have a booth, or
private box, built for my aunts. But what do you
suppose she said to me, girls?” groaned Molly.</p>

<p>“What did she say?” was the response.</p>

<p>“‘Do you suppose you are the only person who
has aunts, Miss Granger?’”</p>

<p>“Never mind, my dear,” said Stella. “Perhaps
all of them won’t come to the exercises.”</p>

<p>“Not all come?” cried Molly. “That would be
awful. Seven is the perfect number in aunts. I
could not spare one of the dears. Why, if Aunt
Celia, Aunt Catherine, Auntie Cora, Aunt Carrie,
Aunt Charlotte, Aunt Cassie and Aunt Cyril did
not appear at Rivercliff to see me graduate, I—I—— Well!
I should not feel as though I were
graduated, that’s all!”</p>

<p>All this only a day or two before the great occasion.
Beth was taking home to one of her best
customers the last piece of work she would do at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
Rivercliff School. As she crossed the Boulevard
she was suddenly conscious of an old-fashioned
family equipage, a pair of fat bay horses, a fat
footman and a fatter coachman, which drew across
her line of vision and stopped. And there was a
fat brown hand, on which sparkled several diamonds,
waving to her from the carriage window.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Ricardo Severn. She beckoned
Beth to come near.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br>

<small>VOCATIONAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My</span> dear child! How well you are looking!”
drawled Mrs. Severn, just as though she had seen
Beth only the week before and that their intercourse
had been quite calm and placid.</p>

<p>Beth did not know just what to say; so, as Ella
would have remarked, “she said it with a vengeance!”
She stood perfectly still.</p>

<p>“My nephew, Roland, keeps me posted regarding
you, my dear,” continued the lady.</p>

<p>“Ah—indeed? I have not seen Mr. Severn for
a fortnight, I believe,” said Beth, feeling vastly
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear! Then you haven’t heard the
news,” cried Mrs. Severn.</p>

<p>“What news?” asked Beth.</p>

<p>“About poor Mr. Montague. About my poor
parrot,” said the lady.</p>

<p>“I have heard nothing about the parrot—no,”
admitted Beth.</p>

<p>“Why, we took up that heavy carpet in my room
ten days ago and what do you think?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>“Oh, Mrs. Severn!” exclaimed Beth, suddenly
interested and excited. “Did you find——?”</p>

<p>“Ever so many things I had missed—yes,” said
the lady, complacently. “The poor dear had been
taking and hiding things under the edge of the carpet,
along the mopboard under the windows. That
sunburst of mine was found right under the bay
window. Wasn’t that funny?”</p>

<p>Beth thought of the grief and shame the loss of
the sunburst had caused her, and she could not,
for the life of her, extract an iota of humor from
the fact.</p>

<p>“But that was just like the wretched creature,”
went on Mrs. Severn. “Will you believe it? That
parrot had deceived me for years and years. Quite
twenty years I have owned him. But now I have
sent him away for good.”</p>

<p>And the selfish old woman drove away, leaving
Beth something to be thankful for, but feeling that
Mrs. Ricardo Severn was a very unfeeling person.</p>

<p>The graduation of Beth and her classmates was
really a very pretty occasion; Miss Hammersly declared
(as usual) that no finer class of girls had
ever left her rooftree.</p>

<p>Rivercliff was crowded on that day, and the
great central room of the gymnasium was used
for the dance and reception at night. Of course,
everybody was present—including the perfect number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
in aunts. Likewise, Mrs. Baldwin came as the
guest of Mrs. Haven.</p>

<p>Really, to see and hear Mrs. Haven one might
have thought that “our Beth” was her daughter
instead of Priscilla Baldwin’s oldest child.</p>

<p>“And do you remember, Priscilla,” said Larry’s
mother, wiping her eyes when the blue-ribboned diplomas
were given out, “how we planned, years
and years ago, that my Larry and your eldest girl
should marry?”</p>

<p>“That was a long time ago,” said Mrs. Baldwin,
rather primly.</p>

<p>“But they do make a wonderfully good looking
couple together,” whispered Mrs. Haven a little
later, when Larry stood with a group of the girls,
which included another of the graduation day
guests—Miss Freylinghausen. Cynthia had one
arm around Beth and another around Molly, and
looked to be enjoying herself.</p>

<p>Before the dancing began that evening, Larry
sent up word to Number Eighty where Beth had
served tea, to ask that the occupant of that room
would give him a few moments of her time. And
Beth tripped down in her new evening frock in
answer to the summons. Evidently, Larry had
laid his plans with wit and judgment. He led her
into the madam’s room—and it was empty.</p>

<p>“See what I have for you to-night, Beth,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
said, eyeing her laughingly, yet admiringly. He
opened the box he carried and displayed its contents.</p>

<p>“With the compliments and love,” he said, his
voice shaking a little, “of Mrs. Euphemia Haven—God
bless her! Your Great-grandmother’s corals,
Beth. They are to be yours again. She never
intended to keep them for herself, but wants you
to have them back now to wear—and for your
very own.”</p>

<p>Beth looked at him—looked away—tried to
say something, and Larry added, softly:</p>

<p>“You can’t refuse them, Beth—you can’t. You
would quite break the Mater’s heart, dear—and
mine!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“How long are you really going to teach school,
Beth?” demanded Ella some weeks later, after
Beth had been to the State capital and passed her
examination before the school board.</p>

<p>“Two years at least, my dear.”</p>

<p>“My goodness! do you suppose Larry will ever
wait that long?”</p>

<p>“Larry will have to wait, my dear,” said the
elder sister, firmly. Then her eyes suddenly sparkled.
“He must wait, at least, until he can accomplish
one particular thing.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” the flyaway sister demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>“Until he can afford to pay the cook’s wages
out of his earnings as a ‘limb o’ the law.’”</p>

<p>It was about this time, too, in the lazy summer
following Beth’s graduation that she received a
letter from Molly Granger, in which was the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“So he agrees we are to wait till Captain John
comes home to marry Aunt Carrie, and then we
shall have a double wedding. At least two of ‘the
Granger girls’ will not die old maids.</p>

<p>“I am awfully glad, Beth Baldwin, that you
went to work for Mrs. Ricardo Severn. Otherwise,
I am quite sure that I would never expect
soon to sign myself, ‘Mrs. Roland Severn, née
J. Molly Granger, no longer F. W.’”</p>
</div>

<p>“What’s the good, I want to know,” said Marcus
Baldwin, one night, evidently having thought
hard and long upon the problem, “for you girls to
go in for the highbrow ed. and then get married
right smack off?”</p>

<p>“Not marrying ‘right smack off!’” denied Ella,
vigorously. “Our Beth is going to teach at least
two years.”</p>

<p>“Well, that jolly girl isn’t.”</p>

<p>“She’s going to teach after she is married, and
so is Mr. Severn,” laughed Beth, “unless Mrs. Ricardo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
Severn remembers him very liberally indeed.”</p>

<p>“Well, a whole lot of you higher-ed. girls do
marry right off,” repeated Marcus.</p>

<p>“And why not? We’re better fitted for life, no
matter what it brings to us, if we have had a good
education. Oh,” declared Beth, now quite grown
up, “I am not sorry that I fulfilled my resolve.”</p>

<p class="ph2"><small>SOMETHING ABOUT</small><br>
AMY BELL MARLOWE<br>
<small>AND HER BOOKS FOR GIRLS</small></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> these days, when the printing presses are
turning out so many books for girls that are good,
bad and indifferent, it is refreshing to come upon
the works of such a gifted authoress as Miss Amy
Bell Marlowe, who is now under contract to write
exclusively for Messrs. Grosset &amp; Dunlap.</p>

<p>In many ways Miss Marlowe’s books may be
compared with those of Miss Alcott and Mrs.
Meade, but all are thoroughly modern and wholly
American in scene and action. Her plots, while
never improbable, are exceedingly clever, and her
girlish characters are as natural as they are interesting.</p>

<p>On the following pages will be found a list
of Miss Marlowe’s books. Every girl in our
land ought to read these fresh and wholesome
tales. They are to be found at all booksellers.
Each volume is handsomely illustrated and bound
in cloth, stamped in colors. Published by Grosset
&amp; Dunlap, New York. A free catalogue of Miss
Marlowe’s books may be had for the asking.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="ph1">THE OLDEST OF FOUR</p>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I don’t</span> see any way out!”</p>

<p>It was Natalie’s mother who said that, after
the awful news had been received that Mr. Raymond
had been lost in a shipwreck on the Atlantic.
Natalie was the oldest of four children, and the
family was left with but scant means for support.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to do something—yes, I’ve just got
to!” Natalie said to herself, and what the brave
girl did is well related in “The Oldest of Four;
Or, Natalie’s Way Out.” In this volume we
find Natalie with a strong desire to become a
writer. At first she contributes to a local paper,
but soon she aspires to larger things, and comes
in contact with the editor of a popular magazine.
This man becomes her warm friend, and not only
aids her in a literary way but also helps in a hunt
for the missing Mr. Raymond.</p>

<p>Natalie has many ups and downs, and has to
face more than one bitter disappointment. But
she is a plucky girl through and through.</p>

<p>“One of the brightest girls’ stories ever
penned,” one well-known author has said of this
book, and we agree with him. Natalie is a
thoroughly lovable character, and one long to be
remembered. Published as are all the Amy Bell
Marlowe books, by Grosset &amp; Dunlap, New
York, and for sale by all booksellers. Ask your
dealer to let you look the volume over.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="ph1">THE GIRLS OF HILLCREST FARM</p>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">We’ll</span> go to the old farm, and we’ll take
boarders! We can fix the old place up, and,
maybe, make money!”</p>

<p>The father of the two girls was broken down
in health and a physician had recommended that
he go to the country, where he could get plenty
of fresh air and sunshine. An aunt owned an
abandoned farm and she said the family could
live on this and use the place as they pleased.
It was great sport moving and getting settled,
and the boarders offered one surprise after another.
There was a mystery about the old farm,
and a mystery concerning one of the boarders,
and how the girls got to the bottom of affairs
is told in detail in the story, which is called, “The
Girls of Hillcrest Farm; Or, The Secret of the
Rocks.”</p>

<p>It was great fun to move to the farm, and once
the girls had the scare of their lives. And they
attended a great “vendue” too.</p>

<p>“I just had to write that story—I couldn’t help
it,” said Miss Marlowe, when she handed in the
manuscript. “I knew just such a farm when I
was a little girl, and oh! what fun I had there!
And there was a mystery about that place, too!”</p>

Grosset &amp; Dunlap, New York, and for sale wherever
good books are sold.</p>

<p class="ph1">A LITTLE MISS NOBODY</p>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, she’s only a little nobody! Don’t have
anything to do with her!”</p>

<p>How often poor Nancy Nelson heard those
words, and how they cut her to the heart. And
the saying was true, she <i>was</i> a nobody. She had
no folks, and she did not know where she had
come from. All she did know was that she was
at a boarding school and that a lawyer paid her
tuition bills and gave her a mite of spending
money.</p>

<p>“I am going to find out who I am, and where
I came from,” said Nancy to herself, one day,
and what she did, and how it all ended, is absorbingly
related in “A Little Miss Nobody;
Or, With the Girls of Pinewood Hall.” Nancy
made a warm friend of a poor office boy who
worked for that lawyer, and this boy kept his
eyes and ears open and learned many things.</p>

<p>The book tells much about boarding school
life, of study and fun mixed, and of a great race
on skates. Nancy made some friends as well as
enemies, and on more than one occasion proved
that she was “true blue” in the best meaning
of that term.</p>

<p class="ph1">THE GIRL FROM SUNSET RANCH</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> was very thoughtful as she rode along
the trail from Sunset Ranch to the View. She
had lost her father but a month before, and
he had passed away with a stain on his name—a
stain of many years’ standing, as the girl had just
found out.</p>

<p>“I am going to New York and I am going to
clear his name!” she resolved, and just then she
saw a young man dashing along, close to the edge
of a cliff. Over he went, and Helen, with no
thought of the danger to herself, went to the
rescue.</p>

<p>Then the brave Western girl found herself set
down at the Grand Central Terminal in New
York City. She knew not which way to go or
what to do. Her relatives, who thought she was
poor and ignorant, had refused to even meet her.
She had to fight her way along from the start,
and how she did this, and won out, is well related
in “The Girl from Sunset Ranch; Or, Alone in
a Great City.”</p>

<p>This is one of the finest of Amy Bell Marlowe’s
books, with its true-to-life scenes of the plains
and mountains, and of the great metropolis.
Helen is a girl all readers will love from the
start.</p>

<p class="ph1">WYN’S CAMPING DAYS</p>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, girls, such news!” cried Wynifred Mallory
to her chums, one day. “We can go camping
on Lake Honotonka! Isn’t it grand!”</p>

<p>It certainly was, and the members of the Go-Ahead
Club were delighted. Soon they set off,
with their boy friends to keep them company in
another camp not far away. Those boys played
numerous tricks on the girls, and the girls retaliated,
you may be sure. And then Wyn did
a strange girl a favor, and learned how some
ancient statues of rare value had been lost in the
lake, and how the girl’s father was accused of
stealing them.</p>

<p>“We must do all we can for that girl,” said
Wyn. But this was not so easy, for the girl
campers had many troubles of their own. They
had canoe races, and one of them fell overboard
and came close to drowning, and then came a big
storm, and a nearby tree was struck by lightning.</p>

<p>“I used to love to go camping when a girl, and
I love to go yet,” said Miss Marlowe, in speaking
of this tale, which is called, “Wyn’s Camping
Days; Or, The Outing of the Go-Ahead Club.”
“I think all girls ought to know the pleasures of
summer life under canvas.”</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
